We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for \u2026"

We show that a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide RNA, generates a DNA recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, RNA polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding. This system, which we call CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. CRISPRi can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells.

We show here that Cas9 assembles with hybrid guide RNAs in human cells and can induce the formation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) at a site complementary to the guide RNA sequence in genomic DNA. This cleavage activity requires both Cas9 and the complementary binding of the guide RNA. Experiments using extracts from transfected cells show that RNA expression and/or assembly into Cas9 is the limiting factor for Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. In addition, we find that extension of the RNA sequence at the 3\u2032 end enhances DNA targeting activity in vivo. These results show that RNA-programmed genome editing is a facile strategy for introducing site-specific genetic changes in human cells.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00471.001"

Similar to RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in eukaryotes, CRISPR-mediated immune systems rely on small RNAs for sequence-specific detection and silencing of foreign nucleic acids, including viruses and plasmids. However, the mechanism of RNA-based bacterial immunity is distinct from RNAi. Understanding how small RNAs are used to find and destroy foreign nucleic acids will provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms of RNA-controlled genetic silencing systems."

Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical experiments to determine how Cas9\u2013RNA interrogates DNA to find specific cleavage sites. We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9\u2013RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9\u2013RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA\u2013DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end \u2026"

Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a that completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that target-activated, nonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase activation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar sensitivity for DNA detection.

The catalytic core of these ribozymes is formed by two structural domains. The 2.8-angstrom crystal structure of one of these, the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila intron, is described. In the 160-nucleotide domain, a sharp bend allows stacked helices of the conserved core to pack alongside helices of an adjacent region. Two specific long-range interactions clamp the two halves of the domain together: a two-Mg2+-coordinated adenosine-rich corkscrew plugs into the minor groove of a helix, and a GAAA hairpin loop binds to a conserved 11-nucleotide internal loop. Metal- and ribose-mediated backbone contacts further stabilize the close side-by-side helical packing. The structure indicates the extent of RNA packing required for the function of large ribozymes, the spliceosome \u2026"

Target recognition strictly requires the presence of a short protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target site, and subsequent R-loop formation and strand scission are driven by complementary base pairing between the guide RNA and target DNA, Cas9\u2013DNA interactions, and associated conformational changes. The use of CRISPR\u2013Cas9 as an RNA-programmable DNA targeting and editing platform is simplified by a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) mimicking the natural dual trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA)\u2013CRISPR RNA (crRNA) structure. This review aims to provide an in-depth mechanistic and structural understanding of Cas9-mediated RNA-guided DNA targeting and cleavage. Molecular insights from biochemical and structural studies provide a framework for rational engineering aimed at altering catalytic function, guide RNA specificity, and PAM requirements and reducing off-target activity for the development of Cas9-based therapies against genetic diseases."

In the crystal structure of an intact Dicer enzyme, the PAZ domain, a module that binds the end of dsRNA, is separated from the two catalytic ribonuclease III (RNase III) domains by a flat, positively charged surface. The 65 angstrom distance between the PAZ and RNase III domains matches the length spanned by 25 base pairs of RNA. Thus, Dicer itself is a molecular ruler that recognizes dsRNA and cleaves a specified distance from the helical end."

Building on previous work , we show here that new genetic information can be introduced site-specifically and with high efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) of Cas9-induced site-specific double-strand DNA breaks using timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Cas9 RNP-mediated HDR in HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and human embryonic stem cells was increased dramatically relative to experiments in unsynchronized cells, with rates of HDR up to 38% observed in HEK293T cells. Sequencing of on- and potential off-target sites showed that editing occurred with high fidelity, while cell mortality was minimized. This approach provides a simple and highly effective strategy for enhancing site-specific genome engineering in both transformed and primary human cells.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04766.001"

Specialized ribonucleases and RNA-binding proteins govern the production and action of small regulatory RNAs. After initial processing in the nucleus by Drosha, precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are transported to the cytoplasm, where Dicer cleavage generates mature microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These double-stranded products assemble with Argonaute proteins such that one strand is preferentially selected and used to guide sequence-specific silencing of complementary target mRNAs by endonucleolytic cleavage or translational repression. Molecular structures of Dicer and Argonaute proteins, and of RNA-bound complexes, have offered exciting insights into the mechanisms operating at the heart of RNA-silencing pathways."

Unique among these are the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated) systems, which provide adaptive immunity against foreign nucleic acids. CRISPR systems function by acquiring genetic records of invaders to facilitate robust interference upon reinfection. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the diverse mechanisms by which Cas proteins respond to foreign nucleic acids and how these systems have been harnessed for precision genome manipulation in a wide array of organisms."

We obtained crystals of a 72-nucleotide, self-cleaved form of the genomic HDV ribozyme that diffract X-rays to 2.3\u2009\u00c5 resolution by engineering the RNA to bind a small, basic protein without affecting ribozyme activity. The co-crystal structure shows that the compact catalytic core comprises five helical segments connected as an intricate nested double pseudoknot. The 5\u2032-hydroxyl leaving group resulting from the self-scission reaction is buried deep within an active-site cleft produced by juxtaposition of the helices and five strand-crossovers, and is surrounded by biochemically important backbone and base functional groups in a manner reminiscent of protein enzymes."

The enzyme Dicer cleaves double-stranded RNA precursors, generating short interfering RNAs and microRNAs in the cytoplasm. These small RNAs are transferred to Argonaute proteins, which guide the sequence-specific silencing of messenger RNAs that contain complementary sequences by either enzymatically cleaving the mRNA or repressing its translation. The molecular structures of Dicer and the Argonaute proteins, free and bound to small RNAs, have offered exciting insights into the molecular mechanisms that are central to RNA silencing pathways."

Central to this immune system is the production of CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) after transcription of the CRISPR locus. Here, we identify the endoribonuclease (Csy4) responsible for CRISPR transcript (pre-crRNA) processing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A 1.8 angstrom crystal structure of Csy4 bound to its cognate RNA reveals that Csy4 makes sequence-specific interactions in the major groove of the crRNA repeat stem-loop. Together with electrostatic contacts to the phosphate backbone, these enable Csy4 to bind selectively and cleave pre-crRNAs using phylogenetically conserved serine and histidine residues in the active site. The RNA recognition mechanism identified here explains sequence- and structure-specific processing by a large family of \u2026"

We discuss the rapidly evolving landscape of CRISPR-Cas applications, from gene editing to transcriptional regulation, imaging, and diagnostics. Continuing functional dissection and an expanding landscape of applications position CRISPR-Cas tools at the cutting edge of nucleic acid manipulation that is rewriting biology."

Improved tools are needed to efficiently \u201cknock out\u201d genes and \u201cknock in\u201d targeted genome modifications to modulate T-cell function and correct disease-associated mutations. CRISPR/Cas9 technology is facilitating genome engineering in many cell types, but in human T cells its efficiency has been limited and it has not yet proven useful for targeted nucleotide replacements. Here we report efficient genome engineering in human CD4+ T cells using Cas9:single-guide RNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs). Cas9 RNPs allowed ablation of CXCR4, a coreceptor for HIV entry. Cas9 RNP electroporation caused up to \u223c40% of cells to lose high-level cell-surface expression of CXCR4, and edited cells could be \u2026"

In each case, transcripts derived from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are thought to selectively target invading phage and plasmids in a sequence-specific process involving a variable cassette of CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. The CRISPR locus in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) includes four cas genes that are unique to and conserved in microorganisms harboring the Csy-type (CRISPR system yersinia) immune system. Here we show that the Csy proteins (Csy1\u20134) assemble into a 350 kDa ribonucleoprotein complex that facilitates target recognition by enhancing sequence-specific hybridization between the CRISPR RNA and complementary target sequences. Target recognition is enthalpically driven and localized to a \u201cseed sequence\u201d at the 5 \u2026"

In most cases, this depends on recognition of a modified nucleotide cap on the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA. However, an alternate pathway uses a structured RNA element in the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the messenger or viral RNA called an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy map of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES bound to the 40S ribosomal subunit at about 20 \u212b resolution. IRES binding induces a pronounced conformational change in the 40S subunit and closes the mRNA binding cleft, suggesting a mechanism for IRES-mediated positioning of mRNA in the ribosomal decoding center."

In humans, Ago2 is loaded with miRNAs by the action of a specialized assembly called the RISC-loading complex (RLC), comprising the proteins Ago2, Dicer, and TRBP. Here we show that the human RLC assembles spontaneously in vitro from purified components. No cofactors or chaperones are required for the complex to form. The reconstituted RLC, containing one copy of each protein, has the dicing, slicing, guide-strand selection, and Ago2-loading activities observed for the endogenous RLC. Furthermore, once Ago2 is loaded with an miRNA, it tends to dissociate from the rest of the complex. These results lay the groundwork for future structural and functional dissection of RISC loading in humans."

These tools use RNA-guided Cas proteins whose large size (950 to 1400 amino acids) has been considered essential to their specific DNA- or RNA-targeting activities. Here we present a set of CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated archaea that contain Cas14, a family of exceptionally compact RNA-guided nucleases (400 to 700 amino acids). Despite their small size, Cas14 proteins are capable of targeted single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage without restrictive sequence requirements. Moreover, target recognition by Cas14 triggers nonspecific cutting of ssDNA molecules, an activity that enables high-fidelity single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping (Cas14-DETECTR). Metagenomic data show that multiple CRISPR-Cas14 systems evolved independently and \u2026"

The hammerhead, hepatitis delta virus (HDV), hairpin, and Neurospora Varkud satellite (VS) ribozymes are small RNAs of 50\u2013150 nucleotides that perform site-specific self-cleavage (1\u20137). Found in viral, virusoid, or satellite RNA genomes, they process the products of rolling circle replication into genome-length strands (8). The general mechanism of these ribozymes is similar to that of many protein ribonucleases in which a 2 oxygen nucleophile attacks the adjacent phosphate in the RNA backbone, resulting in cleavage products with 2, 3-cyclic phosphate and 5 hydroxyl termini (Figure 1). Unlike protein ribonucleases, however, ribozymes cleave only at a specific location, using base-pairing and tertiary interactions to help align the cleavage site within the catalytic core. The evolutionary maintenance of these sequences may be due to their site specificity and to the simplicity and efficiency of genome self-cleavage.Group I and II introns and ribonuclease P (RNase P) are larger, more structurally complex ribozymes several hundred nucleotides in length (9\u201311). RNase P cleaves precursor RNA substrates at specific sites to generate functional 5 termini (12), and group I and II introns catalyze two-step self-splicing reactions (13\u201315). In these large ribozymes, the nucleophile and the labile phosphate are located on different molecules or are greatly separated in sequence. Thus, the complex folds of these RNAs serve to orient the nucleophile and \u2026"

The role of this R-loop structure in positioning each DNA strand for cleavage by the two Cas9 nuclease domains is unknown. We determine molecular structures of the catalytically active Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 R-loop that show the displaced DNA strand located near the RuvC nuclease domain active site. These protein-DNA interactions, in turn, position the HNH nuclease domain adjacent to the target DNA strand cleavage site in a conformation essential for concerted DNA cutting. Cas9 bends the DNA helix by 30\u00b0, providing the structural distortion needed for R-loop formation."

In type II CRISPR-Cas systems, activation of Cas9 endonuclease for DNA recognition upon guide RNA binding occurs by an unknown mechanism. Crystal structures of Cas9 bound to single-guide RNA reveal a conformation distinct from both the apo and DNA-bound states, in which the 10-nucleotide RNA \u201cseed\u201d sequence required for initial DNA interrogation is preordered in an A-form conformation. This segment of the guide RNA is essential for Cas9 to form a DNA recognition\u2013competent structure that is poised to engage double-stranded DNA target sequences. We construe this as convergent evolution of a \u201cseed\u201d mechanism reminiscent of that used by Argonaute proteins during RNA interference in eukaryotes."

We demonstrate that miRNA-mediated mRNA deadenylation occurs subsequent to initial translational inhibition, indicating a two-step mechanism of miRNA action, which serves to consolidate repression. We show that a let-7 miRNA-loaded RNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and the CAF1 and CCR4 deadenylases. In addition, we demonstrate that miRNA-mediated deadenylation is dependent upon CAF1 activity and PABP, which serves as a bona fide miRNA coactivator.

A flexible means to target RNA would allow alteration and imaging of endogenous RNA transcripts analogous to CRISPR/Cas-based genomic tools, but most RNA targeting methods rely on incorporation of exogenous tags. Here, we demonstrate that nuclease-inactive S. pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 can bind RNA in a nucleic-acid-programmed manner and allow endogenous RNA tracking in living cells. We show that nuclear-localized RNA-targeting Cas9 (RCas9) is exported to the cytoplasm only in the presence of sgRNAs targeting mRNA and observe accumulation of ACTB, CCNA2, and TFRC mRNAs in RNA granules that correlate with fluorescence in situ hybridization. We also demonstrate time-resolved measurements of ACTB mRNA \u2026"

We describe here the 1.8 angstrom crystal structure of the universal core of the SRP, revealing protein recognition of a distorted RNA minor groove. Nucleotide analog interference mapping demonstrates the biological importance of observed interactions, and genetic results show that this core is functional in vivo. The structure explains why the conserved residues in the protein and RNA are required for SRP assembly and defines a signal sequence recognition surface composed of both protein and RNA."

At three separate locations in the 160-nucleotide domain, adjacent adenosines in the sequence lie side-by-side and form a pseudo-base pair within a helix. This adenosine platform opens the minor groove for base stacking or base pairing with nucleotides from a noncontiguous RNA strand. The platform motif has a distinctive chemical modification signature that may enable its detection in other structured RNAs. The ability of this motif to facilitate higher order folding provides one explanation for the abundance of adenosine residues in internal loops of many RNAs."

In hepatitis C virus (HCV), the IRES RNA functionally replaces several large initiation factor proteins by directly recruiting the 43S particle. Using quantitative binding assays, modification interference of binding, and chemical and enzymatic footprinting experiments, we show that three independently folded tertiary structural domains in the IRES RNA make intimate contacts to two purified components of the 43S particle: the 40S ribosomal subunit and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3). We measure the affinity and demonstrate the specificity of these interactions for the first time and show that the high affinity interaction of IRES RNA with the 40S subunit drives formation of the IRES RNA[bull ]40S[bull ]eIF3 ternary complex. Thus, the HCV \u2026"

We show here that the tertiary structure of the Tetrahymena group I intron P4-P6 domain nucleates around a magnesium ion core. In the domain crystal structure, five magnesium ions bind in a three-helix junction at the centre of the molecule. Single atom changes in any one of four magnesium sites in this three-helix junction destroy folding of the entire 160-nucleotide P4-P6 domain. The magnesium ion core may be the RNA counterpart to the protein hydrophobic core, burying parts of the RNA molecule in the native structure."

Changes in the influenza polymerase overcome one such barrier. Viruses isolated from birds generally contain polymerases with the avian-signature glutamic acid at amino acid 627 in the PB2 subunit. These polymerases display restricted activity in human cells. An adaptive change in this residue from glutamic acid to the human-signature lysine confers high levels of polymerase activity in human cells. This mutation permits escape from a species-specific restriction factor that targets polymerases from avian viruses. A 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza A virus recently established a pandemic infection in humans, even though the virus encodes a PB2 with the restrictive glutamic acid at amino acid 627. We show here that the 2009 H1N1 virus has acquired second-site suppressor mutations in its PB2 \u2026"

The ribonucleoprotein complex Cascade utilizes RNAs generated from these loci to target complementary \u201cnonself\u201d DNA sequences for destruction, while avoiding binding to \u201cself\u201d sequences within the CRISPR locus. Here we show that CasA, the largest protein subunit of Cascade, is required for nonself target recognition and binding. Combining a 2.3 \u00c5 crystal structure of CasA with cryo-EM structures of Cascade, we have identified a loop that is required for viral defense. This loop contacts a conserved three base pair motif that is required for nonself target selection. Our data suggest a model in which the CasA loop scans DNA for this short motif prior to target destabilization and binding \u2026"

Dicer enzymes uniquely generate RNA products of specific lengths by mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that the PAZ domain responsible for dsRNA end recognition confers this measuring ability through both its structural position and RNA-binding specificity. Point mutations define the dsRNA-binding surface and reveal a protein loop important for cleavage of substrates containing perfect or imperfect base pairing. On the basis of these results, we reengineered Dicer with a U1A RNA-binding domain in place of the PAZ domain to create an enzyme with altered end-recognition specificity and RNA product length. These results explain how Dicer functions as a molecular ruler and provide a structural basis for modifying \u2026"

The assay achieved \u223c100 copies/\u03bcL sensitivity in under 30 min of measurement time and accurately detected pre-extracted RNA from a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 min. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity and directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics.

Here we show that the purified Cas1\u2013Cas2 complex integrates oligonucleotide DNA substrates into acceptor DNA to yield products similar to those generated by retroviral integrases and transposases. Cas1 is the catalytic subunit and Cas2 substantially increases integration activity. Protospacer DNA with free 3\u2032-OH ends and supercoiled target DNA are required, and integration occurs preferentially at the ends of CRISPR repeats and at sequences adjacent to cruciform structures abutting AT-rich regions, similar to the CRISPR leader sequence. Our results demonstrate the Cas1\u2013Cas2 complex to be the minimal machinery that catalyses spacer DNA \u2026"

Here, we use single-particle tracking to visualize diffusion and chromatin binding of Cas9 in living cells. We show that three-dimensional diffusion dominates Cas9 searching in vivo, and off-target binding events are, on average, short-lived (<1 second). Searching is dependent on the local chromatin environment, with less sampling and slower movement within heterochromatin. These results reveal how the bacterial Cas9 protein interrogates mammalian genomes and navigates eukaryotic chromatin structure."

In the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme, site-specific self-cleavage of the viral RNA phosphodiester backbone 1, 2, 3 requires both divalent cations and a cytidine nucleotide 4, 5, 6. General acid\u2013base catalysis 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, substrate destabilization 1, 13 and global and local conformational changes 14, 15 have all been proposed to contribute to the ribozyme catalytic mechanism. Here we report ten crystal structures of the HDV ribozyme in its pre-cleaved state, showing that cytidine is positioned to activate the 2\u2032-OH nucleophile in the precursor structure. This observation supports its proposed role as a general base in the reaction mechanism. Comparison of crystal structures of the ribozyme in the pre-and post-cleavage states reveals a significant conformational change in the RNA after cleavage \u2026"

To investigate the molecular determinants and relevance of the interlobe rearrangement for target recognition and cleavage, we designed a split-Cas9 enzyme in which the nuclease lobe and \u03b1-helical lobe are expressed as separate polypeptides. Although the lobes do not interact on their own, the sgRNA recruits them into a ternary complex that recapitulates the activity of full-length Cas9 and catalyzes site-specific DNA cleavage.

Cryo\u2013electron microscopy reconstructions show that eIF3, a five-lobed particle, interacts with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES RNA and the 5\u2032-cap binding complex eIF4F via the same domain. Detailed modeling of eIF3 and eIF4F onto the 40S ribosomal subunit reveals that eIF3 uses eIF4F or the HCV IRES in structurally similar ways to position the mRNA strand near the exit site of 40S, promoting initiation complex assembly."

A handful of discoveries have changed the course of human history. This book is about the most recent and potentially the most powerful and dangerous of them all. It is an invention that allows us to rewrite the genetic code that shapes and controls all living beings. As a result, dreams of genetic manipulation have become a stark reality: the power to cure disease and alleviate suffering, as well as to re-design any species, including humans, for our own ends. Jennifer Doudna is the co-inventor of this technology-known as CRISPR-and a scientist of worldwide renown. Writing with fellow researcher Samuel Sternberg, here she provides the definitive account of her discovery, explaining how this wondrous invention works and what it is capable of. She also asks us to consider what our new-found power means: how do we enjoy its unprecedented benefits while avoiding its equally unprecedented dangers? _________________ PRAISE FOR A CRACK IN CREATION:'The future is in our hands as never before, and this book explains the stakes like no other'George Lucas' One of the most PIONEERING women in science...

This nucleic acid-based immune system is mediated by a variable cassette of up to 45 protein families that represent distinct immune system subtypes. CRISPR-associated gene 1 (cas1) encodes the only universally conserved protein component of CRISPR immune systems, yet its function is unknown. Here we show that the Cas1 protein is a metal-dependent DNA-specific endonuclease that produces double-stranded DNA fragments of \u223c80 base pairs in length. The 2.2 \u00c5 crystal structure of the Cas1 protein reveals a distinct fold and a conserved divalent metal ion-binding site. Mutation of metal ion-binding residues, chelation of metal ions, or metal-ion substitution inhibits Cas1-catalyzed DNA degradation. These results provide a foundation \u2026"

Members of the RNase III enzyme family, including Escherichia coli RNase III, Rnt1, Dicer and Drosha, share the ability to recognize and cleave double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), typically at specific positions or sequences. Recent biochemical and structural data have shed new light on how RNase III enzymes catalyze dsRNA hydrolysis and how substrate specificity is achieved. A major theme emerging from these studies is that accessory domains present in different RNase III enzymes are the key determinants of substrate selectivity, which in turn dictates the specialized biological function of each type of RNase III protein."

We show that the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA4 binds only to assembled Cas9\u2013single-guide RNA (sgRNA) complexes and not to Cas9 protein alone. A 3.9 \u00c5 resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the Cas9-sgRNA-AcrIIA4 complex revealed that the surface of AcrIIA4 is highly acidic and binds with a 1:1 stoichiometry to a region of Cas9 that normally engages the DNA protospacer \u2026"

Detection of cytosolic DNA triggers downstream immune signaling through activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS).

The catalytic core of cGAS is structurally homologous to the RNA-sensing enzyme, 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligo-adenylate synthase (OAS), and divergent C-terminal domains account for specific ligand-activation requirements of each enzyme. We show that the cGAS zinc ribbon is essential for STING-dependent induction of the interferon response and that conserved amino acids displayed within the intervening loops are required for efficient cytosolic DNA recognition. These results demonstrate that cGAS and OAS define a family of innate \u2026"

Large RNAs can form compact globular structures, but the chemical basis for close helical packing within these molecules has been unclear. Analysis of transfer, catalysis, in vitro-selected and ribosomal RNAs reveal that helical packing predominantly involves the interaction of single-stranded adenosines with a helix minor groove. Using the Tetrahymena thermophila group I ribozyme, we show here that the near-perfect shape complementarity between the adenine base and the minor groove allows for optimal van der Waals contacts, extensive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic surface burial, creating a highly energetically favorable interaction. Adenosine is recognized in a chemically similar fashion by a combination of protein and RNA components in the ribonucleoprotein core of the signal recognition \u2026"

Here we report the structure and function of the effector complex of the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system of Thermus thermophilus: the Csm complex (TtCsm). TtCsm is composed of five different protein subunits (Csm1\u2013Csm5) with an uneven stoichiometry and a single crRNA of variable size (35\u201353 nt). The TtCsm crRNA content is similar to the Type III-B Cmr complex, indicating that crRNAs are shared among different subtypes. A negative stain EM structure of the TtCsm complex exhibits the characteristic architecture of Type I and Type III CRISPR-associated ribonucleoprotein complexes. crRNA-protein crosslinking studies show extensive contacts between the Csm3 backbone and the bound crRNA. We show that, like TtCmr, TtCsm cleaves complementary target RNAs at multiple sites. Unlike \u2026"

We evolved the deaminase component of ABE7.10 using phage-assisted non-continuous and continuous evolution (PANCE and PACE), which resulted in ABE8e. ABE8e contains eight additional mutations that increase activity (kapp) 590-fold compared with that of ABE7.10. ABE8e offers substantially improved editing efficiencies when paired with a variety of Cas9 or Cas12 homologs. ABE8e is more processive than ABE7.10, which could benefit screening, disruption of regulatory regions and multiplex base editing applications. A modest increase in Cas9-dependent and -independent DNA off-target editing, and in transcriptome-wide RNA off-target editing can be ameliorated by the introduction of an additional mutation in the TadA \u2026"

Our results show that the 13-subunit complex can be maintained intact in the gas phase, enabling us to establish unambiguously its stoichiometry and its overall subunit architecture via tandem mass spectrometry and solution disruption experiments. Dissociation takes place as a function of ionic strength to form three stable modules eIF3(c:d:e:l:k), eIF3(f:h:m), and eIF3(a:b:i:g). These modules are linked by interactions between subunits eIF3b:c and eIF3c:h.

The approximate secondary structure and minimum functional length of the HCV IRES are known, and extensive mutagenesis has established that nearly all secondary structural domains are critical for activity. However, the presence of an IRES RNA tertiary fold and its functional relevance have not been established. Using chemical and enzymatic probes of the HCV IRES RNA in solution, we show that the IRES adopts a unique three-dimensional structure at physiological salt concentrations in the absence of additional cofactors or the translation apparatus. Folding of the IRES involves cooperative uptake of magnesium and is driven primarily by charge neutralization. This tertiary structure contains at least two \u2026"

We describe a minimal functional CRISPR-Cas system, comprising a single ~70-kilodalton protein, Cas\u03a6, and a CRISPR array, encoded exclusively in the genomes of huge bacteriophages. Cas\u03a6 uses a single active site for both CRISPR RNA (crRNA) processing and crRNA-guided DNA cutting to target foreign nucleic acids. This hypercompact system is active in vitro and in human and plant cells with expanded target recognition capabilities relative to other CRISPR-Cas proteins. Useful for genome editing and DNA detection but with a molecular weight half that of Cas9 and Cas12a genome-editing enzymes, Cas\u03a6 offers advantages for cellular delivery that expand the genome editing toolbox."

Although the mechanism of RNA recognition and length-specific cleavage by Dicer has been established, the way in which dicing activity is regulated is unclear. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of human Dicer, which is homologous to DExD/H-box helicases, substantially attenuates the rate of substrate cleavage. Deletion or mutation of this domain activates human Dicer in both single- and multiple-turnover assays. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the deletion construct is increased by 65-fold over that exhibited by the intact enzyme. Kinetic analysis shows that this activation is almost entirely due to an enhancement in kcat. Modest stimulation of catalysis by the full-length Dicer enzyme was observed in the \u2026"

The CRISPR\u2013Cas systems of phages have the capacity to silence host transcription factors and translational genes, potentially as part of a larger interaction network that intercepts translation to redirect biosynthesis to phage-encoded functions.

Although the phylogenetically conserved RNA-binding proteins TRBP and PACT are known to contribute to this process, their mode of Dicer binding and their genome-wide effects on miRNA processing have not been determined. We solved the crystal structure of the human Dicer-TRBP interface, revealing the structural basis of the interaction. Interface residues conserved between TRBP and PACT show that the proteins bind to Dicer in a similar manner and by mutual exclusion. Based on the structure, a catalytically active Dicer that cannot bind TRBP or PACT was designed and introduced into Dicer-deficient mammalian cells, revealing selective defects in guide strand selection. These results demonstrate the role of Dicer-associated \u2026"

While divalent metal ions have been directly implicated in RNA tertiary structure formation, the role of monovalent ions has been largely unexplored. Here we report the first specific monovalent metal ion binding site within a catalytic RNA. As seen crystallographically, a potassium ion is coordinated immediately below AA platforms of the Tetrahymena ribozyme P4-P6 domain, including that within the tetraloop receptor. Interference and kinetic experiments demonstrate that potassium ion binding within the tetraloop receptor stabilizes the folding of the P4-P6 domain and enhances the activity of the Azoarcus group I intron. Since a monovalent ion binding site is integral to the tetraloop receptor, a tertiary structural motif that occurs frequently in RNA, monovalent metal ions are likely to participate in the folding and activity of a wide diversity of RNAs."

However, the relationship between human transcript diversity and protein production is complex as each isoform can be translated differently. We fractionated a polysome profile and reconstructed transcript isoforms from each fraction, which we term Transcript Isoforms in Polysomes sequencing (TrIP-seq). Analysis of these data revealed regulatory features that control ribosome occupancy and translational output of each transcript isoform. We extracted a panel of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions that control protein production from an unrelated gene in cells over a 100-fold range. Select 5\u2032 untranslated regions exert robust translational control between cell lines, while 3\u2032 untranslated regions can confer cell type-specific expression. These results expose the large dynamic range of transcript \u2026"

In some eukaryotic viruses, RNA upstream of the coding region forms an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that directly binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and enables translation initiation in the absence of many canonical translation initiation factors. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES RNA requires just two initiation factors, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 and eIF3, to form preinitiation 48S ribosomal complexes that subsequently assemble into translation-competent ribosomes. Using an RNA-based affinity purification approach, we show here that HCV IRES RNA facilitates eIF2 function through its interactions with eIF3 and the 40S ribosomal subunit. Although the wild-type IRES assembles normally into 48S and 80S ribosomal complexes in human cell extract, mutant IRES RNAs become \u2026"

Human cells encode a single Dicer enzyme that can associate with two different double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding proteins, protein activator of PKR (PACT) and trans-activation response RNA-binding protein (TRBP). However, the functional redundancy or differentiation of PACT and TRBP in miRNA and siRNA biogenesis is not well understood. Using a reconstituted system, we show here that PACT and TRBP have distinct effects on Dicer-mediated dsRNA processing. In particular, we found that PACT in complex with Dicer inhibits the processing of pre-siRNA substrates when compared with Dicer and a Dicer\u2013TRBP complex.

The Cascade complex then recruits Cas3, a nuclease-helicase that catalyzes unwinding and cleavage of foreign double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bearing a sequence matching that of the crRNA. Cascade comprises the CasA\u2013E proteins and one crRNA, forming a structure that binds and unwinds dsDNA to form an R loop in which the target strand of the DNA base pairs with the 32-nt RNA guide sequence.

Here we show that seven yeast genes required for invasive growth, a developmental pathway induced by nutrient limitation, contain potent IRESs that require the initiation factor eIF4G for cap-independent translation. In contrast to the RNA structure-based activity of viral IRESs, we show that an unstructured A-rich element mediates internal initiation via recruitment of the poly(A) binding protein (Pab1) to the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of invasive growth messages. A 5\u2032UTR mutation that impairs IRES activity compromises invasive growth, which \u2026"

In type VI-A CRISPR-Cas systems, the signature protein Cas13a (formerly C2c2) contains two separate ribonuclease activities that catalyze crRNA maturation and ssRNA degradation. The Cas13a protein family occurs across different bacterial phyla and varies widely in both protein sequence and corresponding crRNA sequence conservation. Although grouped phylogenetically together, we show that the Cas13a enzyme family comprises two distinct functional groups that recognize orthogonal sets of crRNAs and possess different ssRNA cleavage specificities. These functional distinctions could not be bioinformatically predicted, suggesting more subtle co-evolution of Cas13a enzymes. Additionally, we find that Cas13a pre-crRNA processing is not essential for ssRNA \u2026"

Small bacteriophage-encoded anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) can inactivate Cas9, providing an efficient off switch for Cas9-based applications. Here, we show that two Acrs, AcrIIC1 and AcrIIC3, inhibit Cas9 by distinct strategies. AcrIIC1 is a broad-spectrum Cas9 inhibitor that prevents DNA cutting by multiple divergent Cas9 orthologs through direct binding to the conserved HNH catalytic domain of Cas9. A crystal structure of an AcrIIC1-Cas9 HNH domain complex shows how AcrIIC1 traps Cas9 in a DNA-bound but catalytically inactive state. By contrast, AcrIIC3 blocks activity of a single Cas9 ortholog and induces Cas9 dimerization while preventing binding to the target DNA. These two orthogonal mechanisms allow for separate control of Cas9 \u2026"

We show that temperature modulates Cpf1 activity by controlling its ability to access genomic DNA. This effect is stronger on AsCpf1, explaining its lower efficiency in ectothermic organisms. We capitalize on this property to show that temporal control of the temperature allows post-translational modulation of Cpf1-mediated genome editing. Finally, we determine that LbCpf1 significantly increases homology-directed repair in zebrafish, improving current approaches for targeted DNA integration in the genome.

In the tertiary structure of the IRES RNA, two helical junctions create recognition sites for direct binding of the 40S ribosomal subunit and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3). The 2.8 \u00c5 resolution structure of the IIIabc four-way junction, which is critical for binding eIF3, reveals how junction nucleotides interact with an adjacent helix to position regions directly involved in eIF3 recognition. Two of the emergent helices stack to form a nearly continuous A-form duplex, while stacking of the other two helices is interrupted by the insertion of junction residues into the helix minor groove. This distorted stack probably serves as an important recognition surface for the translational machinery."

The bimolecular association rate is only weakly dependent on sequence; however, the dissociation rate greatly increases from< 0.006 s\u2212 1 to> 2 s\u2212 1 upon introduction of mismatches proximal to protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), demonstrating that mismatches encountered early during heteroduplex formation induce rapid rejection of off-target DNA. In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches up to 11 base pairs in length, which prevent DNA cleavage, still allow formation of a stable complex (dissociation rate< 0.006 s\u2212 1), suggesting that extremely slow rejection could sequester Cas9\u2013RNA, increasing the Cas9 \u2026"

Because molecular surfaces of proteins are more chemically varied than those of RNA, the presence of the protein moiety was expected to facilitate crystallization and improve crystal order.

Anemone cGAS appears to produce a 3\u2032,3\u2032 CDN that anemone STING recognizes through nucleobase-specific contacts not observed in human STING. Nevertheless, anemone STING binds mixed-linkage 2\u2032,3\u2032 cGAMP indistinguishably from human STING, trapping a unique structural conformation not induced by 3\u2032,3\u2032 CDNs. These \u2026"

DNA cleavage of Cas9 is controlled by the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain, but the mechanism that governs HNH activation at on-target DNA while reducing cleavage activity at off-target sites remains poorly understood. Using single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer, we identified an intermediate state of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, representing a conformational checkpoint between DNA binding and cleavage. Upon DNA binding, the HNH domain transitions between multiple conformations before docking into its active state. HNH docking requires divalent cations, but not strand scission, and this docked conformation persists following DNA cleavage. Sequence mismatches \u2026"

                "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 bacterial surveillance system has become a versatile tool for genome editing and gene regulation in eukaryotic cells, yet how CRISPR-Cas9 contends with the barriers presented by eukaryotic chromatin is poorly understood. Here we investigate how the smallest unit of chromatin, a nucleosome, constrains the activity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We find that nucleosomes assembled on native DNA sequences are permissive to Cas9 action. However, the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to Cas9 is variable over several orders of magnitude depending on dynamic properties of the DNA sequence and the distance of the PAM site from the nucleosome dyad. We further find that chromatin remodeling enzymes stimulate Cas9 activity on nucleosomal templates. Our findings imply that the spontaneous breathing of nucleosomal DNA together with the action of chromatin remodelers allow Cas9 to effectively act on chromatin in vivo.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13450.001"

Acquired and heritable immunity against bacteriophage and plasmids begins with integration of \u223c30 base pair foreign DNA sequences into the host genome. CRISPR-derived transcripts assemble with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to target complementary nucleic acids for degradation. Here we review recent advances in the structural biology of these targeting complexes, with a focus on structural studies of the multisubunit Type I CRISPR RNA-guided surveillance and the Cas9 DNA endonuclease found in Type II CRISPR-Cas systems. These complexes have distinct structures that are each capable of site-specific double-stranded DNA binding and local helix unwinding."

In Escherichia coli, Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) is an RNA-guided surveillance complex that binds foreign DNA and recruits Cas3, a trans-acting nuclease helicase for target degradation. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Cascade and Cas3 binding to foreign DNA targets. Our analysis reveals two distinct pathways dictated by the presence or absence of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Binding to a protospacer flanked by a PAM recruits a nuclease-active Cas3 for degradation of short single-stranded regions of target DNA, whereas PAM mutations elicit an alternative pathway that recruits a nuclease-inactive Cas3 through a mechanism that is dependent on the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins. These findings explain how target recognition by Cascade can elicit \u2026"

Here, we report the crystal structure of an Xrn1-substrate complex. The single-stranded substrate is held in place by stacking of the 5\u2032-terminal trinucleotide between aromatic side chains while a highly basic pocket specifically recognizes the 5\u2032 phosphate. Mutations of residues involved in binding the 5\u2032-terminal nucleotide impair Xrn1 processivity. The substrate recognition mechanism allows Xrn1 to couple processive hydrolysis to duplex melting in RNA substrates with sufficiently long single-stranded 5\u2032 overhangs. The Xrn1-substrate complex structure thus rationalizes the exclusive specificity of Xrn1 for 5 \u2026"

                "abstract": "RNA plays a direct role in a variety of cellular activities, and in many cases its biological function is conferred by the RNA three-dimensional structure. X-ray crystallography is the method of choice for determining high resolution structures of large RNA molecules, and can also be used to compare related RNAs and identify conformational changes that may accompany biochemical activity. However, crystallization remains the rate-limiting step in RNA structure determination due to the difficulty in obtaining well-ordered crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis. Several approaches to sample preparation, crystallization, and crystal handling are presented that have been used successfully in the structure determination of RNA and RNA\u2013protein complexes in our laboratory, and should be generally applicable to RNAs in other systems."

These findings make it increasingly possible to compare details of RNA- and protein-based catalysis."

Chemical synthesis of RNA duplexes enabled the introduction of base analogs that tested the role of specific functional groups in the major and minor grooves of the RNA helix. The results of these experiments indicate that an unpaired guanine 2-amino group at a specific position in the minor groove of an RNA helix marks a molecule for aminoacylation with alanine."

A major determinant of species tropism is the identity of amino acid 627 in the PB2 subunit of the heterotrimeric influenza polymerase; glutamic acid predominates in avian PB2, whereas lysine occupies this position in human isolates. We show that a dominant inhibitory activity in human cells potently and selectively restricts the function of polymerases containing an avian-like PB2 with glutamic acid at residue 627. Restricted polymerases fail to assemble into ribonucleoprotein complexes, resulting in decreased genome transcription, replication, and virus production without any significant effect on relative viral infectivity. Understanding the molecular basis of this species-specific restriction should provide strategies to prevent and treat avian influenza outbreaks in humans."

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) genomic loci are transcribed as long precursor RNAs, which must be enzymatically cleaved to generate mature CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) that serve as guides for foreign nucleic acid targeting and degradation. This processing occurs within the repetitive sequence and is catalyzed by a dedicated Cas6 family member in many CRISPR systems. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, crRNA biogenesis requires the endoribonuclease Csy4 (Cas6f), which binds and cleaves at the 3\u2032 side of a stable RNA stem\u2013loop structure encoded by the CRISPR repeat. We show here that Csy4 recognizes its RNA substrate with an \u223c50 pM equilibrium dissociation constant, making it one of the highest-affinity protein:RNA interactions of \u2026"

Sequencing data show that many miRNAs are produced at different levels and as multiple isoforms that can vary in length at their 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends, but the biogenesis and functional significance of these RNAs are largely unknown. We show here that the human trans-activation response (TAR) RNA binding protein (TRBP), a known molecular partner of the miRNA processing enzyme Dicer, changes the rates of pre-miRNA cleavage in an RNA-structure-specific manner. Furthermore, TRBP can trigger the generation of iso-miRNAs (isomiRs) that are longer than the canonical sequence by one nucleotide. We show that this change in miRNA processing site can alter guide strand selection, resulting in preferential silencing of a different mRNA target. These results implicate TRBP as a key regulator of miRNA processing and targeting in humans."

In order to understand splice-site selection, we have developed an assay system based on the Tetrahymena ribozyme to allow the study of numerous 5'-splice-site variants. Cleavage at the correct site requires formation of the correct secondary structure and occurs most efficiently within a 3-base-pair window centered on base pair 5 from the bottom of the P1 stem. Within this window the ribozyme recognizes and cleaves at a \"wobble\" base pair; the base pair above the cleavage site also influences splicing efficiency. The recognition of RNA structure rather than sequence explains the ability of these transposable introns to splice out of a variety of sequence contexts."

Following dicing, one dsRNA product strand is preferentially assembled into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The mechanism of strand selection in humans and the possible role of Dicer in this process remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that dsRNAs undergo significant repositioning within Dicer complexes following dicing. This repositioning enables directional binding of RNA duplexes, thereby biasing their orientation for guide strand selection according to the thermodynamic properties of the helix. Our findings indicate that Dicer is itself capable of sensing siRNA thermodynamic asymmetry regardless of the dsRBP to which it is bound. These results support a model in which Dicer employs two distinct RNA-binding sites \u2026"

Here we report that a number of different RNA molecules of 4-50 kDa, all synthesized in vitro, have been crystallized. A highly successful method for the growth of RNA crystals based on previously reported conditions for tRNA crystallization is presented.

Here, we present the crystal structure of the SRP:SR complex at 3.9 angstrom resolution and biochemical data revealing that the activated SRP:SR guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) complex binds the distal end of the SRP hairpin RNA where GTP hydrolysis is stimulated. Combined with previous findings, these results suggest that the SRP:SR GTPase complex initially assembles at the tetraloop end of the SRP RNA and then relocalizes to the opposite end of the RNA. This rearrangement provides a mechanism for coupling GTP hydrolysis to the handover of cargo to the translocon."

Sequence comparison showed that apical loop nucleotides (UUGGGU) were absolutely conserved across HCV genotypes and the GGG triplet was strongly conserved among related Flavivirus andPestivirus nontranslated regions. Chimeric IRES elements with IIId derived from GB virus B (GBV-B) in the context of the HCV IRES possess translational activity. Mutations within the IIId stem loop that abolish IRES activity also affect the RNA structure in \u2026"

Several RNA-based regulatory systems in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and small RNAs (sRNAs) that are dependent on the RNA chaperone protein Hfq, achieve specificity using similar strategies. Central to their function is the presentation of short'seed sequences' within a ribonucleoprotein complex to facilitate the search for and recognition of targets."

Using a massively parallel method to quantify protein\u2013DNA interactions on a high-throughput sequencing flow cell, we comprehensively assess the effects of combinatorial mismatches between guide RNA (gRNA) and target nucleotides, both in the seed and in more distal nucleotides, plus disruption of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).

Conserved charged amino acids on one side of the \u03b2-propeller structure were found to confer most of the 40S subunit binding affinity, whereas an adjacent conserved and structured loop had little effect on RACK1-ribosome association.

Although bacteria harboring CRISPR-Cas9 or CRISPR-Cas3 adaptive immune systems sometimes acquire mobile genetic elements encoding anti-CRISPR proteins that inhibit Cas9, Cas3, or the DNA-binding Cascade complex, no such inhibitors have been found for CRISPR-Cas12a. Here we use a comprehensive bioinformatic and experimental screening approach to identify three different inhibitors that block or diminish CRISPR-Cas12a\u2013mediated genome editing in human cells. We also find a widespread connection between CRISPR self-targeting and inhibitor prevalence in prokaryotic genomes, suggesting a straightforward path to the discovery of many more anti-CRISPRs from the microbial world."

The eIF3 complex also prevents premature association of the 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits and interacts with other initiation factors involved in start codon selection. The molecular mechanisms by which eIF3 exerts these functions are poorly understood. Since its initial characterization in the 1970s, the exact size, composition, and post-translational modifications of mammalian eIF3 have not been rigorously determined. Two powerful mass spectrometric approaches were used in the present study to determine post-translational modifications that may regulate the activity of eIF3 during the translation initiation process and to characterize the molecular structure of the human eIF3 \u2026"

All known Cas9 enzymes are thought to recognize DNA exclusively as a natural substrate, providing protection against DNA phage and plasmids. Here, we show that Cas9 enzymes from both subtypes II-A and II-C can recognize and cleave single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) by an RNA-guided mechanism that is independent of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in the target RNA. RNA-guided RNA cleavage is programmable and site-specific, and we find that this activity can be exploited to reduce infection by single-stranded RNA phage in vivo. We also demonstrate that Cas9 can direct PAM-independent repression of gene expression in bacteria. These results indicate that a subset of Cas9 enzymes have the ability to act on both DNA and RNA target sequences, and suggest the potential for use in programmable RNA targeting applications."

Structural genomics, the systematic determination of all macromolecular structures represented in a genome, is focused at present exclusively on proteins. It is clear, however, that RNA molecules play a variety of significant roles in cells, including protein synthesis and targeting, many forms of RNA processing and splicing, RNA editing and modification, and chromosome end maintenance. To comprehensively understand the biology of a cell, it will ultimately be necessary to know the identity of all encoded RNAs, the molecules with which they interact and the molecular structures of these complexes. This report focuses on the feasibility of structural genomics of RNA, approaches to determining RNA structures and the potential usefulness of an RNA structural database for both \u2026"

CXCR4 or CCR5 knockout cells generated with this method are resistant to HIV infection in a tropism-dependent manner, whereas knockout of LEDGF or TNPO3 results in a tropism-independent reduction in infection. CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs can furthermore edit multiple genes simultaneously, enabling studies of interactions among multiple host and viral factors. Finally, in an arrayed screen of 45 genes associated with HIV integrase, we identified several candidate dependency/restriction factors, demonstrating the power of this \u2026"

To generate immunological memory, the Cas1-Cas2 protein complex captures 30\u201340 base pair segments of foreign DNA and catalyzes their integration into the host genome as unique spacer sequences. Although spacers are inserted strictly at the A-T-rich leader end of CRISPR loci in vivo, the molecular mechanism of leader-specific spacer integration remains poorly understood. Here we show that the E. coli integration host factor (IHF) protein is required for spacer acquisition in vivo and for integration into linear DNA in vitro. IHF binds to the leader sequence and induces a sharp DNA bend, allowing the Cas1-Cas2 integrase to catalyze the first integration reaction at the leader-repeat border. Together, these results reveal that Cas1-Cas2-mediated spacer integration requires IHF-induced target DNA \u2026"

The molecular mechanisms by which eIF3 exerts these functions are poorly understood. To learn more about the structure and function of eIF3 we have expressed and purified individual human eIF3 subunits or complexes of eIF3 subunits using baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The results indicate that the subunits of human eIF3 that have homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae form subcomplexes that reflect the subunit interactions seen in the yeast eIF3 core complex. In addition, we have used an in vitro 40 S ribosomal subunit binding assay to investigate subunit requirements for efficient association of the eIF3 subcomplexes to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. eIF3j alone binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and its \u2026"

Histidine-tagged forms of both wild-type and mutant NIa-Pro were overexpressed in E. coli under conditions in which greater than 95% of the protease was in the insoluble fraction after cell lysis. An inclusion body preparation followed by denaturing purification over a single affinity column and protein renaturation yields greater than 12.5 mg enzyme per liter of bacterial cell culture. NIa-Pro purified according to this protocol has been used for quantitative removal of fusion domains from a variety of proteins prepared for crystallization and biochemical analysis."

This complicated process is driven by both individual gene mutations and genome reassortments. The viral polymerase complex, composed of the proteins PB1, PB2, and PA, is a major factor controlling host adaptation, and reassortment events involving polymerase gene segments occurred with past pandemic viruses. Here we investigate the ability of polymerase reassortment to restore the activity of an avian influenza virus polymerase that is normally impaired in human cells. Our data show that the substitution of human-origin PA subunits into an avian influenza virus polymerase alleviates restriction in human cells and increases polymerase activity in vitro. Reassortants with 2009 pandemic H1N1 PA proteins were the most active. Mutational \u2026"

GeoCas9 is active at temperatures up to 70\u2009\u00b0C, compared to 45\u2009\u00b0C for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9), which expands the temperature range for CRISPR-Cas9 applications.

To date, four RNA folds have been determined at near-atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography: transfer RNA, the hammerhead ribozyme, the P4\u2013P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I intron, and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme. All four folds result in RNAs that are considerably more compact than isolated A-form duplexes. These structures illustrate, to varying degrees, three modes of fold stabilization: association of complementary molecular surfaces, stabilization of close RNA packing by binding of cations, and stabilization through pseudoknotting."

Each contains helical segments and conserved unpaired nucleotides, and the isolated P4-P6 domain has been shown to have substantial native tertiary structure. The proposed tertiary structure domains of the Tetrahymena intron were synthesized separately and shown to self-assemble into a catalytically active complex. Surprisingly, the concentration dependence of these reactions revealed that the domains interact with nanomolar apparent dissociation constants, even though there is no known base pairing between P4-P6 and P3-P9. This suggests that the domains interact through multiple tertiary contacts, the nature of which can now be explored in this system. For example, a circularly permuted version of the P4-P6 domain, which folds similarly to the native P4-P6 molecule, formed a \u2026"

To determine whether this cytosine (C75) in the genomic ribozyme has an altered pKa consistent with its role as a general acid or base, we used 13C NMR to determine its microscopic pKa in the product form of the ribozyme. The measured pKa is moderately shifted from that of a free nucleoside or a base-paired cytosine and has the same divalent metal ion dependence as the apparent reaction pKa's measured kinetically. However, under all conditions tested, the microscopic pKa is lower than the apparent reaction pKa, supporting a model in which C75 is deprotonated in the product form of the ribozyme at physiological pH.

In eukaryotes, translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is thought to play an essential role in this process by influencing mRNA and tRNA binding through indirect interactions on the backside of the 40S subunit. Here we show by directed hydroxyl radical probing that the human eIF3 subunit eIF3j binds to the aminoacyl (A) site and mRNA entry channel of the 40S subunit, placing eIF3j directly in the ribosomal decoding center. eIF3j also interacts with eIF1A and reduces 40S subunit affinity for mRNA. A high affinity for mRNA is restored upon recruitment of initiator tRNA, even though eIF3j remains in the mRNA-binding cleft in the presence of tRNA. These results suggest that eIF3j functions in part by regulating access of the mRNA-binding cleft in response to initiation factor binding."

We previously determined the crystalstructure of a Dicer enzyme from the diplomonad Giardia intestinalis and proposed a structural model for dsRNA processing. Here, we provide evidence that Dicer is composed of three structurally rigid regions connected by flexible hinges andpropose that conformational flexibility facilitates dsRNA binding and processing. We also examine the role of the accessorydomains found in Dicers of higher eukaryotes but absent in Giardia Dicer. Finally, we combine the structure ofDicer with published biochemical data to propose a model for the architecture of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-loading complex."

Subjecting biochemically, covalently and conformationally homogeneous target molecules to an exhaustive array of crystallization conditions is often insufficient to yield crystals large enough for X-ray data collection. Even when large RNA crystals are obtained, they often do not diffract X-rays to resolutions that would lead to biochemically informative structures. We reasoned that a well-folded RNA molecule would typically present a largely undifferentiated molecular surface dominated by the phosphate backbone. During crystal nucleation and growth, this might result in neighboring molecules packing subtly out of register, leading to premature crystal growth cessation and disorder. To overcome this problem, we have developed a crystallization module \u2026"

A fundamental aspect of this process is the asymmetric loading of one strand of a short interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) duplex onto RISCs for correct target recognition. Here, we use a reconstituted system to determine the extent to which the core components of the human RNAi machinery contribute to RNA guide strand selection. We show that Argonaute2 (Ago2), the endonuclease that binds directly to siRNAs and miRNAs within RISC, has intrinsic but substrate-dependent RNA strand selection capability. This activity can be enhanced substantially when Ago2 is in complex with the endonuclease Dicer and the double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (dsRBPs)\u2014trans-activation response (TAR) RNA-binding \u2026"

First, genome-wide measurements of mRNA abundance, translation, and ribosome occupancy after glucose withdrawal show that most mRNAs are depleted from the cell coincident with their depletion from polysomes. Second, only a limited subpopulation of translationally repressed transcripts, comprising fewer than 400 genes, can be reactivated for translation upon glucose readdition in the absence of new transcription.

The core domain of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES contains a four-way helical junction that is integrated within a predicted pseudoknot. This domain is required for positioning the mRNA start codon correctly on the 40S ribosomal subunit during translation initiation. Here, we present the crystal structure of this RNA, revealing a complex double-pseudoknot fold that establishes the alignment of two helical elements on either side of the four-helix junction. The conformation of this core domain constrains the open reading frame's orientation for positioning on the 40S ribosomal subunit. This structure, representing the last major domain of HCV-like IRESs to be determined at near-atomic resolution, provides the basis for a comprehensive cryoelectron microscopy-guided model \u2026"

We describe a fully automated data analysis pipeline for SHAPE-Seq analysis that includes read processing, mapping, and structural inference based on a model of the experiment. Our methods rely on the solution of a series of convex optimization problems for which we develop efficient and effective numerical algorithms. Our results can be easily extended to other chemical probes of RNA structure, and also generalized to modeling polymerase drop-off in other sequence census-based experiments."

Crystallographic analysis of several large RNAs revealed a prevalent interaction in which unpaired adenosine residues dock into the minor groove of a receptor helix. This A-minor motif, potentially the most important element responsible for global RNA architecture, has also been suggested to contribute to the fidelity of protein synthesis by discriminating against near-cognate tRNAs on the ribosome. The specificity of A-minor interactions is fundamental to RNA tertiary structure formation, as well as to their proposed role in translational accuracy. To investigate A-minor motif specificity, we analyzed mutations in an A-minor interaction within the Tetrahymena group I self-splicing intron. Thermodynamic and x-ray crystallographic results show that the A-minor interaction strongly prefers canonical base pairs over base mismatches in \u2026"

Splicing in both cases initiates via nucleophilic attack at the 5\u2032 splice site by the 2\u2032 OH of a conserved intron adenosine residue, creating a branched (lariat) intermediate. Here, we describe the crystal structure at 3.0 \u212b resolution of a 70-nucleotide RNA containing the catalytically essential domains 5 and 6 of the yeast ai5\u03b3 group II self-splicing intron, revealing an unexpected two-nucleotide bulged structure around the branch-point adenosine in domain 6."

We present crystal structures of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product integration complexes, as well as a cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of the full CRISPR locus integration complex, including the accessory protein IHF (integration host factor). The structures show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates integration site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of integration. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR integrase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA structure to ensure site-selective \u2026"

Sarnow oncogenesis contain untranslated regions that are often highly conserved, may extend for several hundred nucleotides, and appear to contain extensive secondary and tertiary structures. As predicted, many such mRNAs are poorly translated (for review, see Kozak 1991). However, in some instances, mRNAs utilize an alternative initiation mechanism of internal ribosome binding in which the 5-untranslated region (5UTR) of the mRNA has an active role in 40S subunit recruitment. The 5-untranslated RNA segments responsible for such internal initiation of translation are known as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs)(see Fig. 1)(for review, see Hellen and Sarnow 2001; Jackson 2005; Komar and Hatzoglou 2005; Pisarev et al. 2005; Spriggs et al. 2005). A detailed understanding of internal translation initiation is important both for elucidating a key mechanism in the control of eukaryotic gene expression and for developing effective antiviral therapies. In this chapter, we discuss viral IRES mechanisms, with a focus on mechanistic insights learned from both structural and biochemical studies of picornaviral, hepatitis C, and cricket paralysis viral IRES-containing RNAs. We also describe translational control mechanisms of cellular mRNAs containing IRES functionalities."

P1.1 consists of two canonical C-G base pairs stacked beneath the G[bull ]U wobble pair at the cleavage site and would appear to pull together critical structural elements of the ribozyme. P1.1 is the second stem of a second pseudoknot in the ribozyme, making the overall fold of the ribozyme a nested double pseudoknot. Sequence comparison suggests the potential for P1.1 and a similar fold in the antigenomic ribozyme. In this study, the base pairing requirements of P1.1 for cleavage activity were tested in both the genomic and antigenomic HDV ribozymes by mutagenesis. In both sequences, cleavage activity was severely reduced when mismatches were introduced into P1.1, but restored when alternative base \u2026"

The crystal structure of the universally conserved RNA-protein core of the Escherichia coli SRP, refined here to 1.5 \u00c5 resolution, revealed minor groove recognition of the 4.5 S RNA component by the M domain of the Ffh protein. Within the RNA, nucleotides comprising two phylogenetically conserved internal loops create a unique surface for protein recognition. To determine the energetic importance of conserved nucleotides for SRP assembly, we measured the affinity of the M domain for a series of RNA mutants. This analysis reveals how conserved nucleotides within the two internal loop motifs establish the architecture of the macromolecular interface and position essential functional groups for direct recognition by the protein."

A combined top\u2010down and bottom\u2010up mass spectrometry approach was used to identify both the proteins and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in the native 40S subunit and the IRES recruited translation initiation complex.

The active site catalytic dyad lacks a general acid to protonate the leaving group and positively charged residues to stabilize the transition state, explaining why the observed catalytic rate constant is \u223c104\u2010fold slower than that of RNase A.

This process could potentially be disrupted by small ligands that bind specifically to autoantibodies and inhibit their interaction with the target antigen. Here we report the identification of an RNA sequence that binds a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for an autoantigenic epitope of human insulin receptor. The RNA ligand binds specifically and with high affinity (apparent Kd congruent to 2 nM) to the anti-insulin receptor antibody and not to other mouse IgGs. The RNA can also act as a decoy, blocking the antibody from binding the insulin receptor. Thus, it probably binds near the combining site on the antibody. Strikingly, the RNA cross-reacts with autoantibodies from patients with extreme insulin resistance. One simple explanation is that the selected RNA may structurally mimic \u2026"

We show that CRISPR-Cas9-based gene repression (CRISPRi) can be either activated or deactivated in a dose-dependent fashion over a >10-fold dynamic range in response to two different small-molecule ligands. Since our system acts directly on each target-specific sgRNA, it enables new applications that require differential and opposing temporal control of multiple genes."

This structural core in eIF3 binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, to translation initiation factors involved in mRNA cap-dependent initiation, and to the hepatitis C viral (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA. Addition of the remaining eIF3 subunits enables reconstituted eIF3 to assemble intact initiation complexes with the HCV IRES. Negative-stain EM reconstructions of reconstituted eIF3 further reveal how the approximately 400 kDa molecular mass structural core organizes the highly flexible 800 kDa \u2026"

In SC2-VLPs, four nucleocapsid (N) mutations found universally in more-transmissible variants independently increased messenger RNA delivery and expression ~10-fold, and in a reverse genetics model, the serine-202\u2192arginine (S202R) and arginine-203\u2192methionine (R203M) mutations each produced >50 times as much virus.

We show here that the CRISPR-associated Marinitoga piezophila Argonaute (MpAgo) protein cleaves single-stranded target sequences using 5\u2032-hydroxylated guide RNAs rather than the 5\u2032-phosphorylated guides used by all known Argonautes.

As a result of their programmable ability to cut specific DNA and RNA sequences, Cas9 and related single-subunit effector proteins from CRISPR\u2013Cas systems have been widely adopted for research and therapeutic genome engineering applications. In this Review, we discuss the chemistry of macromolecules involved in the multistep interference pathway used by CRISPR\u2013Cas systems that mediate accurate nucleic acid target recognition and cutting. Although this Review mainly focuses on DNA interference by Cas9, we briefly explore nucleic acid targeting by the single-effector proteins Cas12 and Cas13 to emphasize the conserved themes of precision DNA and RNA cleavage within class 2 CRISPR\u2013Cas systems.

Cas9-guide RNA complexes recognize 20-base-pair sequences in DNA and generate a site-specific double-strand break, a robust activity harnessed for genome editing. DNA recognition by all studied Cas9 enzymes requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) next to the target site. We show that Cas9 enzymes from evolutionarily divergent bacteria can recognize and cleave single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by an RNA-guided, PAM-independent recognition mechanism. Comparative analysis shows that in contrast to the type II-A S. pyogenes Cas9 that is widely used for genome engineering, the smaller type II-C Cas9 proteins have limited dsDNA binding and unwinding activity and promiscuous guide RNA specificity. These results indicate that inefficiency of type II-C Cas9 enzymes for genome editing results \u2026"

Although Cas9-mediated genome editing has been shown to be highly specific, cleavage events at off-target sites have also been reported. Minimizing, and eventually abolishing, unwanted off-target cleavage remains a major goal of the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 technology before its implementation for therapeutic use. Recent efforts have turned to chemical biology and biophysical approaches to engineer inducible genome editing systems for controlling Cas9 activity at the transcriptional and protein levels.

We found that thousands of genes change translation status during differentiation without a corresponding change in RNA level. Specifically, we identified mTOR signaling as a key driver for elevated translation of translation-related genes in hESCs.

The mammalian enzyme cGAS synthesizes a unique cyclic dinucleotide (cGAMP) containing a 2\u02b9\u20135\u02b9 phosphodiester linkage essential for optimal immune stimulation, but the molecular basis for linkage specificity is unknown. Here, we show that the Vibrio cholerae pathogenicity factor DncV is a prokaryotic cGAS-like enzyme whose activity provides a mechanistic rationale for the unique ability of cGAS to produce 2\u02b9\u20135\u02b9 cGAMP. Three high-resolution crystal structures show that DncV and human cGAS generate CDNs in sequential reactions that proceed in opposing directions. We explain 2\u02b9 and 3\u02b9 linkage specificity and test this model by reprogramming the human cGAS active site to produce 3\u02b9\u20135\u02b9 cGAMP, leading to selective stimulation of alternative STING adaptor alleles in cells.

We show here that two copies of miR-122 interact with the HCV 5\u2032UTR at partially overlapping positions near the 5\u2032 end of the viral transcript to form a stable ternary complex. Both miR-122 binding sites involve extensive base pairing outside of the seed sequence; yet, they have substantially different interaction affinities. Structural probing reveals changes in the architecture of the HCV 5\u2032UTR that occur on interaction with miR-122. In contrast to previous reports, however, results using both the \u2026"

In Type I and III CRISPR/Cas systems, the Cas6 family of endoribonucleases generates functional CRISPR-derived RNAs by site-specific cleavage of repeat sequences in precursor transcripts. CRISPR repeats differ widely in both sequence and structure, with varying propensity to form hairpin folds immediately preceding the cleavage site. To investigate the evolution of distinct mechanisms for the recognition of diverse CRISPR repeats by Cas6 enzymes, we determined crystal structures of two Thermus thermophilus Cas6 enzymes both alone and bound to substrate and product RNAs. These structures show how the scaffold common to all Cas6 endonucleases has evolved two binding sites with distinct \u2026"

The IRES includes a predicted pseudoknot interaction near the AUG start codon, but the results of previous studies of its structure have been conflicting. Using mutational analysis coupled with activity and functional assays, we verified the importance of pseudoknot base pairings for IRES-mediated translation and, using 35 mutants, conducted a comprehensive study of the structural tolerance and functional contributions of the pseudoknot. Ribosomal toeprinting experiments show that the entirety of the pseudoknot element positions the initiation codon in the mRNA binding cleft of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Optimal spacing between the pseudoknot and the start site AUG resembles that between the Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence and the \u2026"

We further show that PF-06446846 reduces plasma PCSK9 and total cholesterol levels in rats following oral dosing. Using ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that PF-06446846 is highly selective for the inhibition of PCSK9 translation. The mechanism of action employed by PF-06446846 reveals a previously unexpected tunability of the human ribosome that allows small molecules to specifically block translation of individual transcripts."

In many cases, activity could be regained by making additional mutations that restored predicted base-pairings; these second site suppressors in general confirm the secondary structure derived from phylogenetic data. At several positions, our suppression data can be most readily explained by assuming non-Watson-Crick base-pairings. In addition to the requirements imposed by the secondary structure, the sequence of the intron is constrained by \u201cnegative interactions\u201d, the exclusion of particular nucleotide sequences that would form undersirable secondary structures.

These mutations specifically recruit the multimeric ETS factor GABP, which can form two functionally independent transcription factor species: a dimer or a tetramer. We show that genetic disruption of GABP\u03b21L (\u03b21L), a tetramer-forming isoform of GABP that is dispensable for normal development, results in TERT silencing in a TERT promoter mutation-dependent manner. Reducing TERT expression by disrupting \u03b21L culminates in telomere loss and cell death exclusively in TERT promoter mutant cells. Orthotopic xenografting of \u03b21L-reduced, TERT promoter mutant glioblastoma cells rendered lower tumor burden and longer overall survival in mice. These results highlight the critical role of GABP\u03b21L in enabling immortality in TERT promoter mutant glioblastoma."

Key components of the defense system are ribonucleoprotein complexes, the composition of which appears highly variable in different CRISPR/Cas subtypes. Previous studies combined mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and small angle x-ray scattering to demonstrate that the E. coli Cascade complex (405 kDa) and the P. aeruginosa Csy-complex (350 kDa) are similar in that they share a central spiral-shaped hexameric structure, flanked by associating proteins and one CRISPR RNA. Recently, a cryo-electron microscopy structure of Cascade revealed that the CRISPR RNA molecule resides in a groove of the hexameric backbone. For both complexes we \u2026"

The specific contributions of human Dicer's structural domains to RNA product length and substrate preference are incompletely understood, due in part to the difficulties of Dicer purification. Here, we show that active forms of human Dicer can be assembled from recombinant polypeptides expressed in bacteria. Using this system, we find that three distinct modes of RNA recognition give rise to Dicer's fidelity and product length specificity. The first involves anchoring one end of a double\u2010stranded RNA helix within the PAZ domain, which can assemble in trans with Dicer's catalytic domains to reconstitute an accurate but non-substrate-selective dicing activity. The second entails nonspecific RNA binding by the double-stranded RNA binding domain, an interaction that is essential for substrate \u2026"

In the Tetrahymena intron, half of the catalytic core resides within the independently-folding P4\u2212P6 domain while the other half belongs to a putative domain that includes helices P3, P7, P8, and P9 (P3\u2212P9). To determine whether the P3\u2212P9 region of the intron can also fold independently, we used Fe(II)-EDTA and dimethyl sulfate to probe the solvent accessibility of separate fragments of the Tetrahymena intron. These RNAs self-assemble into an active complex in trans, enabling analysis of their structural features both alone and within the complex. Our results show that while the P3\u2212P9 region of the intron retains its secondary structure, most of the tertiary interactions within this region do not form stably in the absence of the P4\u2212P6 domain. This indicates that the P4\u2212P6 domain induces folding in the P3\u2212P9 \u2026"

Low-voltage electric pulses permeabilize a small area of cell membrane as a cell comes into close contact with the nanopores. The biomolecule cargo is then electrophoretically drawn into the cells through the nanopores. In addition to high-performance delivery with low cell toxicity, the NanoEP system does not require specialized buffers, expensive materials, complicated fabrication processes, or cell manipulation; it simply consists of a generic nanopore-embedded water-filter membrane and a low-voltage square-wave generator. Ultimately, the NanoEP platform offers an effective and flexible method for universal intracellular delivery."

In bacteria, Cas12a enzymes can be inhibited by bacteriophage-derived proteins, anti-CRISPRs (Acrs), to thwart clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) adaptive immune systems. How these inhibitors disable Cas12a by preventing programmed DNA cleavage is unknown. We show that three such inhibitors (AcrVA1, AcrVA4 and AcrVA5) block Cas12a activity via functionally distinct mechanisms, including a previously unobserved enzymatic strategy. AcrVA4 and AcrVA5 inhibit recognition of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), with AcrVA4 driving dimerization of Cas12a. In contrast, AcrVA1 is a multiple-turnover inhibitor that triggers cleavage of the target-recognition sequence of the Cas12a-bound guide RNA to irreversibly inactivate the Cas12a complex.

Although a unique RNA structure has been proposed for the Rev-response element (RRE) responsible for viral mRNA export, how it recruits multiple HIV Rev proteins to form an export complex has been unclear. We show here that initial binding of Rev to the RRE triggers RNA tertiary structural changes, enabling further Rev binding and the rapid formation of a viral export complex. Analysis of the Rev-RRE assembly pathway using SHAPE-Seq and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals two major steps of Rev-RRE complex formation, beginning with rapid Rev binding to a pre-organized region presenting multiple Rev binding sites. This step induces long-range remodeling of the RNA to expose a cryptic Rev binding site, enabling rapid assembly of additional Rev proteins into the RNA export complex. This kinetic pathway \u2026"

Monovalent metal ions support slow catalysis and were proposed to substitute for structural, but not catalytic, divalent metal ions in the RNA. To investigate the role of monovalent cations in ribozyme structure and function, we determined the crystal structure of the precursor HDV ribozyme in the presence of thallium ions (Tl+). Two Tl+ ions can occupy a previously observed divalent metal ion hexahydrate-binding site located near the scissile phosphate, but are easily competed away by cobalt hexammine, a magnesium hexahydrate mimic and potent reaction inhibitor. Intriguingly, a third Tl+ ion forms direct inner-sphere contacts with the ribose 2\u2032-OH nucleophile and the pro-Sp scissile phosphate oxygen. We discuss possible \u2026"

Bms1, an essential protein in yeast, is the only known GTPase required for biosynthesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit and interacts with Rcl1, an essential protein suggested to be an endonuclease. Here, we show thermodynamic coupling in the binding of Bms1 to GTP, Rcl1, and U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), an essential RNA that base pairs to pre-rRNA. Rcl1 binding to preribosomes is severely limited in yeast cells expressing a Bms1 mutant defective for Rcl1 binding. Additionally, we provide evidence that the C-terminal domain of Bms1 acts as an intramolecular GTPase-activating protein. Together, these data \u2026"

Type III-A systems use a multisubunit interference complex called Csm, containing Cas proteins and a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target cognate nucleic acids. The Csm complex is intriguing in that it mediates RNA-guided targeting of both RNA and transcriptionally active DNA, but the mechanism is not well understood. Here, we overexpressed the five components of the Thermus thermophilus (T. thermophilus) Type III-A Csm complex (TthCsm) with a defined crRNA sequence, and purified intact TthCsm complexes from E. coli cells. The complexes were thermophilic, targeting complementary ssRNA more efficiently at 65\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C. Sequence-independent, endonucleolytic cleavage of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by TthCsm was triggered by recognition of a complementary ssRNA, and required a lack of complementarity between the first 8 nucleotides (5\u2032 tag) of the crRNA and the 3\u2032 flanking region of the ssRNA. Mutation of the histidine-aspartate (HD) nuclease domain of the TthCsm subunit, Cas10/Csm1, abolished DNA cleavage. Activation of DNA cleavage was dependent on RNA binding but not cleavage. This leads to a model in which binding of an ssRNA target to the Csm complex would stimulate cleavage of exposed ssDNA in the cell, such as could occur when the RNA polymerase unwinds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) during transcription. Our findings establish an amenable, thermostable system for more in \u2026"

Using sequencing experiments coupled with in vitro biochemistry, we find that Cas13a target RNA binding affinity and HEPN-nuclease activity are differentially affected by the number and the position of mismatches between the guide and the target. We identify a central binding seed for which perfect base pairing is required for target binding and a separate nuclease switch for which imperfect base pairing results in tight binding, but not HEPN-nuclease activation. These results demonstrate that the binding and cleavage activities of Cas13a are decoupled, highlighting \u2026"

An inactive version of the Csy4 nuclease binds irreversibly to transcripts engineered with a 16-nt hairpin sequence at their 5\u2032 ends. Once immobilized by Csy4 on a solid support, contaminating proteins and other molecules can be removed by extensive washing. Upon addition of imidazole, Csy4 is activated to cleave the RNA, removing the hairpin tag and releasing the native transcript along with its specifically bound protein partners. This conditional Csy4 enzyme enables recovery of specific RNA-binding partners with minimal false-positive contamination.

Using both biochemical and genetic experiments, we show here that SRP RNA enhances GTPase activity of the SRP\u2013receptor complex above a critical threshold required for cell viability. Furthermore, this stimulation is a property of the SRP RNA tetraloop.

Although most type I and type III CRISPR systems require four or more distinct proteins to form multi-subunit surveillance complexes, the type I-C systems use just three proteins to achieve crRNA maturation and double-stranded DNA target recognition. We show that each protein plays multiple functional and structural roles: Cas5c cleaves pre-crRNAs and recruits Cas7 to position the RNA guide for DNA binding and unwinding by Cas8c. Cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of free and DNA-bound forms of the Cascade/I-C surveillance complex reveal conformational changes that enable R-loop formation with distinct positioning of each DNA strand. This streamlined type I-C system explains how CRISPR pathways can evolve \u2026"

Briefly, CRISPR\u2013Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (crRNPs) are synthesized in vitro and delivered to activated CD4+ T cells by nucleofection. These cells are then assayed for editing efficiency and expanded for use in downstream cellular, genetic, or protein-based assays. This platform supports the rapid, arrayed generation of multiple gene manipulations and is widely adaptable across culture conditions, infection protocols, and downstream applications.

The catalytically active ribonucleoprotein (RNP) has splicing, endonuclease, and reverse transcriptase activity, enabling efficient insertion of the intron sequence by a retro-homing mechanism. To determine the composition and assembly mechanism of the RNP complex, purified LtrA protein was analyzed for its ability to recognize a series of intron-derived RNAs. Equilibrium dissociation measurements show that LtrA recognizes two intronic domains, DI and DIV.

Chemical footprinting and the crystal structure of the Tetrahymena intron P4\u2212P6 domain revealed that tertiary interactions between these two parts of the domain create an extensive solvent-inaccessible interface. We have examined the formation and stability of this tertiary interface by providing the P5abc segment in trans to a Tetrahymena ribozyme construct that lacks P5abc (E\u0394P5abc). Equilibrium gel shift experiments show that the affinity of the P5abc and E\u0394P5abc RNAs is exceptionally strong, with a Kd of \u223c100 pM at 10 mM MgCl2 (at 37 \u00b0C).

These proteins appear to have arisen independently multiple times in evolution and function through diverse mechanisms to inhibit CRISPR-Cas immunity. For comprehensive reviews on anti-CRISPRs, we direct readers to recent publications. 1, 2 Due to the increasing interest in anti-CRISPRs, many new families of these proteins have been discovered in the past year or so. There are now 36 distinct families of anti-CRISPRs described in the literature that block seven subtypes of CRISPR-Cas systems. 3\u201312 In 2015, a naming system for anti-CRISPR genes and proteins was introduced. 6, 13 To date, this system has been followed in all subsequent publications describing newly discovered anti-CRISPRs.

We identified a high affinity interaction, conserved among different HCV genotypes, between the HCV 3\u2032UTR and the host ribosome. The 3\u2032UTR interacts with 40S ribosomal subunit proteins residing primarily in a localized region on the 40S solvent-accessible surface near the messenger RNA entry and exit sites. This region partially overlaps with the site where the HCV internal ribosome entry site was found to bind, with the internal ribosome entry site-40S subunit interaction being dominant. Despite its ability to bind to 40S subunits independently, the HCV 3\u2032UTR only stimulates translation              in cis             , without affecting the first round translation rate             .

Using electron microscopy (EM), bioinformatics and biochemical experiments, we identify two highly conserved RNA-binding motifs in eIF3 that direct translation initiation from the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site (HCV IRES) RNA. Mutations in the RNA-binding motif of subunit eIF3a weaken eIF3 binding to the HCV IRES and the 40S ribosomal subunit, thereby suppressing eIF2-dependent recognition of the start codon. Mutations in the eIF3c RNA-binding motif also reduce 40S ribosomal subunit binding to eIF3, and inhibit eIF5B-dependent steps downstream of start codon recognition.

CRISPR proteins have revolutionized genome modification, yet the CRISPR-Cas9 scaffold is not ideal for fusions or activation by cellular triggers. Here, we show that a topological rearrangement of Cas9 using circular permutation provides an advanced platform for RNA-guided genome modification and protection. Through systematic interrogation, we find that protein termini can be positioned adjacent to bound DNA, offering a straightforward mechanism for strategically fusing functional domains. Additionally, circular permutation enabled protease-sensing Cas9s (ProCas9s), a unique class of single-molecule effectors possessing programmable inputs and outputs. ProCas9s can sense a wide range of proteases, and we demonstrate that ProCas9 can orchestrate a cellular response to pathogen-associated protease activity. Together \u2026"

CRISPR\u2013Cas enzymes are widely used for genome editing and offer immense therapeutic opportunity to treat genetic diseases. To realize their full potential, it is important to control the timing, duration, efficiency and specificity of CRISPR\u2013Cas enzyme activities. In this Review we discuss the mechanisms of natural CRISPR\u2013Cas regulatory biomolecules and engineering strategies that enhance or inhibit CRISPR\u2013Cas immunity by altering enzyme function. We also discuss the potential applications of these CRISPR regulators and highlight unanswered questions about their evolution and purpose in nature."

The RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease can be introduced into cells as a purified protein in complex with a single guide RNA (sgRNA). Such ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) can facilitate the high-fidelity introduction of single-base substitutions via HDR following co-delivery with a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. However, combining RNPs with transgene-containing donor templates for targeted gene addition has proven challenging, which in turn has limited the capabilities of the RNP-mediated genome editing toolbox. Here, we demonstrate that combining RNP delivery with naturally recombinogenic adeno-associated virus (AAV) donor vectors enables site-specific gene insertion by homology \u2026"

To understand the molecular basis for DNA adenosine deamination by adenine base editors (ABEs), we determined a 3.2-angstrom resolution cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure of ABE8e in a substrate-bound state in which the deaminase domain engages DNA exposed within the CRISPR-Cas9 R-loop complex. Kinetic and structural data suggest that ABE8e catalyzes DNA deamination up to ~1100-fold faster than earlier ABEs because of mutations that stabilize DNA substrates in a constrained, transfer RNA\u2013like conformation. Furthermore, ABE8e\u2019s accelerated DNA deamination suggests a previously unobserved transient DNA melting that may occur during double-stranded DNA surveillance by CRISPR-Cas9. These results explain ABE8e-mediated base-editing outcomes and inform the future \u2026"

We show here that AcrIIA2 and its more potent homolog, AcrIIA2b, prevent Cas9 binding to DNA by occluding protein residues required for DNA binding. Cryo-EM-determined structures of AcrIIA2 or AcrIIA2b bound to S. pyogenes Cas9 reveal a mode of competitive inhibition of DNA binding that is distinct from other known Acrs. Differences in the temperature dependence of Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA2b arise from differences in both inhibitor structure and the local inhibitor-binding environment on Cas9. These findings expand the natural toolbox for regulating CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing \u2026"

Two base-paired stems (P7.1 and P7.2) that are peculiar to the group IA introns can also be deleted; however, the activities of the resulting derivatives depend greatly on the choice of replacement sequences and their lengths. The smallest active derivative is less than 180 nucleotides long. These experiments help to define the minimum structural requirements for catalysis."

Notably, the genomes of a wide variety of eukaryotes encode multiple distinct variants of eIF4G. We found that deletion of eIF4G1, but not eIF4G2, impairs growth and global translation initiation rates in budding yeast under standard laboratory conditions. Not all mRNAs are equally sensitive to loss of eIF4G1; genes that encode messages with longer poly(A) tails are preferentially affected. However, eIF4G1-deletion strains contain significantly lower levels of total eIF4G, relative to eIF4G2-delete or wild type strains. Homogenic strains, which encode two copies of either eIF4G1 or eIF4G2 under native promoter control, express a single isoform at levels similar to the total amount of eIF4G in a wild type cell and have a similar capacity to support normal translation initiation rates. Polysome microarray analysis of these strains and the wild type parent showed that translationally active mRNAs are similar. These results suggest that total eIF4G levels, but not isoform-specific functions, determine mRNA-specific translational efficiency."

Noncanonical base pairs, metal ions and 2\u2032-hydroxyl groups are key elements in RNA higher-order structure formation."

Indeed, it has been shown that the Tetrahymena and sunY self-splicing introns will catalyzethe template-directedligation of RNA oligonucleotides (Doudna et al., 1989, 1991). We have sought to develop a more general RNA replication system in which arbitrary template sequences could be copiedby the assembly of a limited set of short oligonucleotides. Here we examine the use of tetranucleotides as substrates for a primer-extension reaction in which the 5'-nucleoside of the tetranucleotide is the leaving group, and the primer is extended by the remaining three nucleotides. When the 5'-nucleoside is guanosine, the reaction is quite efficient, but a number of competing side reactions occur, in which inappropriate \u2026"

This process is now examined for the HCV IRES, indicating that conformational changes are necessary but not sufficient for initiation. Instead, the initiator tRNA, but not its interaction with the start codon, seems key to stabilizing HCV mRNA binding to the ribosome, indicating that this IRES bypasses some, but not all, of the functions of the initiation factors."

To unravel this enigma, we investigated transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP) consisting of three dsRBDs, which functions in HIV replication, protein kinase R(PKR)\u2013mediated immune response, and RNA silencing. Here we report an ATP-independent diffusion activity of TRBP exclusively on dsRNA in a length-dependent manner. The first two dsRBDs of TRBP are essential for diffusion, whereas the third dsRBD is dispensable. Two homologs of TRBP, PKR activator and R3D1-L, displayed the same diffusion, implying a universality of the diffusion activity among this protein family. Furthermore, a Dicer\u2013TRBP complex on dsRNA exhibited dynamic diffusion \u2026"

Despite being implicated in several facets of RNA metabolism, the nature and scope of DDX3\u2032 s interactions with RNA remain unclear. Here, we show DDX3 collaborates extensively with the translation initiation machinery through direct binding to 5\u2032 UTRs of nearly all coding RNAs, specific sites on the 18S rRNA, and multiple components of the translation initiation complex. Impairment of translation initiation is also evident in primary medulloblastomas harboring mutations in DDX3X, further highlighting DDX3\u2032 s role in this process. Arsenite-induced stress shifts DDX3 binding from the 5\u2032 UTR into the coding region of mRNAs concomitant with a general reduction of translation, and both the shift of DDX3 on mRNA and decreased translation \u2026"

CRISPR\u2013Cas nucleases offer programmable RNA-guided RNA recognition that triggers cleavage and release of a fluorescent reporter molecule, but long reaction times hamper their detection sensitivity and speed. Here, we show that unrelated CRISPR nucleases can be deployed in tandem to provide both direct RNA sensing and rapid signal generation, thus enabling robust detection of ~30 molecules per \u00b5l of RNA in 20\u2009min. Combining RNA-guided Cas13 and Csm6 with a chemically stabilized activator creates a one-step assay that can detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA extracted from respiratory swab samples with quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT\u2013PCR)-derived cycle threshold (Ct) values \u2026"

The core is flanked by subfamily-specific extensions of idiosyncratic function. The Ded1/DDX3 subfamily of DEAD-box proteins is of particular interest as members function during protein translation, are essential for viability, and are frequently altered in human malignancies. Here, we define the function of the subfamily-specific extensions of the human DEAD-box protein DDX3. We describe the crystal structure of the subfamily-specific core of wild-type DDX3 at 2.2 \u212b resolution, alone and in the presence of AMP or nonhydrolyzable ATP. These structures illustrate a unique interdomain interaction between the two ATPase domains in which the C-terminal domain clashes with the RNA-binding surface.

The best-studied of these enzymes, Cas12a, initiates DNA cutting by forming a 20-nucleotide R-loop in which the guide RNA displaces one strand of a double-helical DNA substrate, positioning the DNase active site for first-strand cleavage. However, crystal structures and biochemical data have not explained how the second strand is cut to complete the double-strand break. Here, we detect intrinsic instability in DNA flanking the RNA-3\u2032 side of R-loops, which Cas12a can exploit to expose second-strand DNA for cutting. Interestingly, DNA flanking the RNA-5\u2032 side of R-loops is not intrinsically unstable. This asymmetry in R-loop structure may explain the uniformity of guide RNA architecture and the single-active-site cleavage mechanism that are fundamental features of all type V CRISPR-Cas systems."

The essential GTPase Bms1, the putative endonuclease Rcl1 and the essential U3 small nucleolar RNA form a stable subcomplex thought to control an early step in the assembly of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Here, we provide a complete thermodynamic analysis of GTP-dependent subcomplex formation, revealing strong thermodynamic coupling of Rcl1, U3 small nucleolar RNA and GTP binding to Bms1 that is eliminated in the presence of GDP. The results suggest that Rcl1 activates Bms1 by promoting GDP/GTP exchange, analogous to ribosome-promoted nucleotide exchange within translation elongation factor EF-G.

GTP-dependent binding of SRP to its receptor protein leads to controlled release of the nascent chain into a membrane-spanning translocon pore. Here we show that the association of the SRP with its receptor triggers a marked conformational change in the complex, localizing the SRP RNA and the adjacent signal peptide\u2013binding site at the SRP-receptor heterodimer interface. The orientation of the RNA suggests how peptide binding and GTP hydrolysis can be coupled through direct structural contact during cycles of SRP-directed protein translocation."

Many anti-CRISPRs have been found that inhibit the CRISPR\u2013Cas adaptive immune system. However, comparing all currently known anti-CRISPRs does not reveal a shared set of properties for facile bioinformatic identification of new anti-CRISPR families. Here, we describe AcRanker, a machine learning based method to aid direct identification of new potential anti-CRISPRs using only protein sequence information. Using a training set of known anti-CRISPRs, we built a model based on XGBoost ranking. We then applied AcRanker to predict candidate anti-CRISPRs from predicted prophage regions within self-targeting bacterial genomes and discovered two previously unknown anti-CRISPRs \u2026"

Here, we performed genome-resolved metagenomic analysis of one agricultural and seven pristine groundwater microbial communities and recovered 746 CPR and DPANN genomes in total. The pristine sites, which serve as local sources of drinking water, contained up to 31% CPR bacteria and 4% DPANN archaea. We observed little species-level overlap of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across the groundwater sites, indicating that CPR and DPANN communities may be differentiated according to physicochemical conditions and host populations.

A mutant enzyme with an altered guanosine binding site can catalyze template-directed primer extension with all four bases when supplied with dinucleotides of the form 2-aminopurine-pN."

Here we report the 5.9 \u00c5 structure of HIV-1 TAR in complex with HIV-1 Tat and human AFF4, CDK9, and CycT1. The TAR central loop contacts the CycT1 Tat-TAR recognition motif (TRM) and the second Tat Zn2+-binding loop. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) shows that AFF4 helix 2 is stabilized in the TAR complex despite not touching the RNA, explaining how it enhances TAR binding to the SEC 50-fold. RNA SHAPE and SAXS data were used to help model the extended (Tat Arginine-Rich Motif) ARM, which enters the TAR major groove between the bulge and the central loop. The structure and functional assays collectively support an integrative structure and a bipartite binding model, wherein the TAR central loop engages the CycT1 TRM and compact core of Tat, while the TAR major groove interacts with the extended Tat ARM.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15910.001"

Structural analysis of the RNA and protein components of the prokaryotic SRP in the free and bound states revealed that the RNA undergoes a significant conformational change upon protein binding involving the uptake of several monovalent and divalent cations. To investigate the role of these metal ions in formation of the functional SRP complex, we used binding affinity assays and X-ray crystallography to analyze the specificity and energetic contributions of mono- and divalent metal ions bound in the RNA. Our results demonstrate that several metal ion binding sites important \u2026"

A dynamic and mechanical description of R-loop formation is needed to understand the biophysics of target searching and develop rational approaches for mitigating off-target activity while accounting for the influence of torsional strain in the genome. Here we investigate the dynamics of Cas9 R-loop formation and collapse using rotor bead tracking (RBT), a single-molecule technique that can simultaneously monitor DNA unwinding with base-pair resolution and binding of fluorescently labeled macromolecules in real time.

Upon infection, a low fraction of cells acquire short DNA sequences from the invader. These sequences (spacers) are integrated in between the repeats of the CRISPR locus and immunize the host against the matching invader. Spacers specify the targets of the CRISPR immune response through transcription into short RNA guides that direct Cas nucleases to the invading DNA molecules. Here we performed random mutagenesis of the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease to look for variants that provide enhanced immunity against viral infection. We identified a mutation, I473F, that increases the rate of spacer acquisition by more than two orders of magnitude. Our results highlight the role of Cas9 during CRISPR immunization and provide a useful tool to study this rare process and develop it as \u2026"

Since they are composed of completely different chemical building blocks, however, RNAs and proteins necessarily use distinct strategies to assemble complex architectures. While burial of hydrophobic residues drives protein folding, the hydrophobic effect in RNA contributes primarily to the formation of secondary structure. To form tertiary structure, RNA must overcome electrostatic repulsions from the phosphate backbone. How do negatively charged double helices pack together to produce catalytic centers and ligand binding surfaces? Here, we review our understanding of the principles that underlie RNA folding based on the structural information currently available."

                "abstract": "Argonaute (Ago) proteins are widespread in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and share a four-domain architecture capable of RNA- or DNA-guided nucleic acid recognition. Previous studies identified a prokaryotic Argonaute protein from the eubacterium Marinitoga piezophila (MpAgo), which binds preferentially to 5\u2032-hydroxylated guide RNAs and cleaves single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and DNA (ssDNA) targets. Here we present a 3.2 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of MpAgo bound to a 21-nucleotide RNA guide and a complementary 21-nucleotide ssDNA substrate. Comparison of this ternary complex to other target-bound Argonaute structures reveals a unique orientation of the N-terminal domain, resulting in a straight helical axis of the entire RNA-DNA heteroduplex through the central cleft of the protein. Additionally, mismatches introduced into the heteroduplex reduce MpAgo cleavage efficiency with a symmetric profile centered around the middle of the helix. This pattern differs from the canonical mismatch tolerance of other Argonautes, which display decreased cleavage efficiency for substrates bearing sequence mismatches to the 5\u2032 region of the guide strand. This structural analysis of MpAgo bound to a hybrid helix advances our understanding of the diversity of target recognition mechanisms by Argonaute proteins."

The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been widely adopted as a powerful genome-editing tool, and phage-encoded inhibitors, known as anti-CRISPRs, offer a means of regulating its activity. Here, we report the crystal structures of anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIC2Nme alone and in complex with Nme1Cas9. We demonstrate that AcrIIC2Nme inhibits Cas9 through interactions with the positively charged bridge helix, thereby preventing sgRNA loading. In vivo phage plaque assays and in vitro DNA cleavage assays show that AcrIIC2Nme mediates its activity through a large electronegative surface. This work shows that anti-CRISPR activity can be mediated through the inhibition of Cas9 complex assembly."

Recently, methods have been developed that make the task of modeling RNA structure and dynamics significantly easier and more reliable. We have used ERRASER and PHENIX to rebuild and re-refine the cleaved and cis-acting C75U-inhibited structures of the HDV ribozyme. The results correct local conformations and identify alternates for RNA residues, many in functionally important regions, leading to improved R values and model validation statistics for both structures.

Herein we show that the enzyme tyrosinase is capable of oxidizing exposed tyrosine residues into o-quinones that react rapidly with cysteine residues on target proteins. This coupling reaction occurs under mild aerobic conditions and has the rare ability to join full-size proteins in under 2 h. The utility of the approach is demonstrated for the attachment of cationic peptides to enhance the cellular delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 20-fold and for the coupling of reporter proteins to a cancer-targeting antibody fragment without loss of its cell-specific binding ability. The broad applicability of this technique provides a new building block approach for the synthesis of protein chimeras."

Encoded by bacteriophage and phage-derived bacterial genes, Acrs prevent CRISPR-mediated inhibition of phage infection and can also block CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome editing in eukaryotic cells. To identify Acrs capable of inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SauCas9), an alternative to the most commonly used genome editing protein Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9), we used both self-targeting CRISPR screening and guilt-by-association genomic search strategies. Here we describe three potent inhibitors of SauCas9 that we name AcrIIA13, AcrIIA14, and AcrIIA15. These inhibitors share a conserved N-terminal sequence that is dispensable for DNA cleavage inhibition and have divergent C termini that are required in each case for inhibition of SauCas9-catalyzed DNA \u2026"

As Gag assembles on the plasma membrane, the HIV-1 genome is enriched relative to cellular RNAs by an unknown mechanism. We used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5\u2019 untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag which subtly affect the self-assembly of Gag abrogated RNA selectivity. We further found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are thus interdependent on one another.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14663.001"

While individuals infected with Delta are at risk to develop severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals1,2. The question arises whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but no other VOCs, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine \u2026"

We have developed a one-step strategy using engineered lentiviral particles to introduce Cas9 RNPs and a CAR transgene into primary human T cells without electroporation. Furthermore, programming particle tropism allows us to target a specific cell type within a mixed cell population. As a proof-of-concept, we show that HIV-1 envelope targeted particles to edit CD4+ cells while sparing co-cultured CD8+ cells. This \u2026"

We show here that a short-complementarity untranslated RNA (scoutRNA), together with crRNA, is required for Cas12d-catalyzed DNA cutting. The scoutRNA differs in secondary structure from previously described tracrRNAs used by CRISPR-Cas9 and some Cas12 enzymes, and in Cas12d-containing systems, scoutRNA includes a conserved five-nucleotide sequence that is essential for activity. In addition to supporting crRNA-directed DNA recognition, biochemical and cell-based experiments establish scoutRNA as an essential cofactor for Cas12c-catalyzed pre-crRNA maturation.

CRISPR-based diagnostics that utilize RNA and DNA-targeting enzymes can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable and accurate. Here we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a-based mobile phone assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA extracts. The assay achieved \u223c100 copies/\u03bcL sensitivity in under 30 minutes and accurately detected a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 minutes. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity, and we directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Combined with mobile phone-based quantification, this assay can provide rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening to aid in the control of SARS-CoV-2."

Although the physiological function of eukaryotic Agos in regulating gene expression is well documented, the biological roles of many of their prokaryotic counterparts remain enigmatic. In some bacteria, Agos are associated with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci and use noncanonical 5\u2032-hydroxylated guide RNAs (gRNAs) for nucleic acid targeting. Here we show that using 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as the 5\u2032 nucleotide of gRNAs stabilizes in vitro reconstituted CRISPR-associated Marinitoga piezophila Argonaute\u2013gRNA complexes (MpAgo RNPs) and significantly improves their specificity and affinity for RNA targets. Using reconstituted MpAgo RNPs with 5\u2032-BrdU-modified gRNAs, we mapped the seed region of the gRNA and identified the nucleotides of the gRNA that play the most significant role in \u2026"

Evolutionary pressure by CRISPR-Cas has driven bacteriophage to evolve small protein inhibitors, anti-CRISPRs (Acrs), that block Cas enzyme function by wide-ranging mechanisms. We show here that the inhibitor AcrVA4 uses a previously undescribed strategy to recognize the L. bacterium Cas12a (LbCas12a) pre-crRNA processing nuclease, forming a Cas12a dimer, and allosterically inhibiting DNA binding. The Ac. species Cas12a (AsCas12a) enzyme, widely used for genome editing applications, contains an ancestral helical bundle that blocks AcrVA4 binding and allows it to escape anti-CRISPR recognition. Using biochemical, microbiological, and human cell editing experiments, we show that Cas12a orthologs can be rendered either sensitive or resistant to AcrVA4 through rational structural engineering informed by evolution. Together, these findings explain a new mode of CRISPR-Cas inhibition and illustrate how structural variability in Cas effectors can drive opportunistic co-evolution of inhibitors by bacteriophage."

Using a construct containing only the RNA binding domain of PSI (PSI-KH03), we introduced a physiologically relevant point mutation into each KH domain of PSI individually and measured stability and RNA binding affinity of the resulting mutant proteins. Although secondary structure, as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy, is only subtly changed for each mutant protein relative to wild type, RNA binding affinity is reduced in each case.

Csm can cleave RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but whether it targets one or both nucleic acids during transcription elongation is unknown. Here, we show that binding of a Thermus thermophilus (T. thermophilus) Csm (TthCsm) to a nascent transcript in a transcription elongation complex (TEC) promotes tethering but not direct contact of TthCsm with RNA polymerase (RNAP). Biochemical experiments show that both TthCsm and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) Csm (SepCsm) cleave RNA transcripts, but not ssDNA, at the transcription bubble. Taken together, these results suggest that Type III systems primarily target transcripts, instead of unwound ssDNA in TECs, for immunity against double-stranded DNA \u2026"

During a large-scale effort to identify small noncoding RNAs in Drosophila, we isolated a U5 snRNA-like molecule containing a 5\u2032 segment identical to that of the canonical (major) U5 snRNA but with a variant Sm binding site and a distinct 3\u2032 hairpin sequence. Based on this finding, another six similar U5 snRNA-like sequences were identified within the Drosophila genome by sequence similarity to the invariant loop in the 5\u2032 half of U5. Interestingly, although all of these variants are expressed in vivo, each shows a distinct temporal expression profile during Drosophila development, and one is expressed primarily in fly heads. The presence of these U5 snRNA variants within RNP particles suggests their role in splicing and implies a possible connection to regulation of developmental and tissue \u2026"

Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems, the most widespread and diverse of these adaptive immune systems, use an RNA-guided multiprotein complex to find foreign nucleic acids and trigger their destruction. In this review, we describe how these multisubunit complexes target and cleave DNA and RNA and how regulatory molecules control their activities. We also highlight similarities to and differences from Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems, which use a single-protein effector, as well as other types of bacterial and eukaryotic immune systems. We summarize current applications of the Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems for DNA/RNA modification, control of gene expression, and nucleic acid detection."

While this approach to microbial genetics has been foundational, its requirement for culturable microorganisms has left the majority of microbes and their interactions genetically unexplored. Here we describe a generalizable methodology for editing the genomes of specific organisms within a complex microbial community. First, we identified genetically tractable bacteria within a community using a new approach, Environmental Transformation Sequencing (ET-Seq), in which non-targeted transposon integrations were mapped and quantified following community delivery. ET-Seq was repeated with multiple delivery strategies for both a nine-member synthetic bacterial community and a ~200-member microbial bioremediation community. We achieved insertions in 10 species not previously isolated and identified natural competence for foreign DNA integration that depends on the presence of the community. Second, we developed and used DNA-editing All-in-one RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas Transposase (DART) systems for targeted DNA insertion into organisms identified as tractable by ET-Seq, enabling organism- and locus-specific genetic manipulation within the community context. These results demonstrate a strategy for targeted genome editing of specific organisms within microbial communities, establishing a new paradigm for microbial manipulation relevant to research and applications in human, environmental, and industrial microbiomes."

Our data establish that FlK is competent to protect its host from fluoroacetate toxicity in vivo and demonstrate a 106-fold discrimination between fluoroacetyl-CoA (kcat/KM = 5 \u00d7 107 M\u22121 s\u22121) and acetyl-CoA (kcat/KM = 30 M\u22121 s\u22121) based on a single fluorine substitution that originates from differences in both substrate reactivity and binding. We show that Thr 42, Glu 50, and His 76 are key catalytic residues and identify several factors that influence substrate selectivity. We propose that FlK minimizes interaction with the thioester carbonyl, leading to selection against acetyl-CoA binding that can be recovered in part by new C\ue5fbO \u2026"

                "abstract": "This chapter discusses the application of X-ray crystallography for solving large RNA structures. RNA crystals tend to decay rapidly when exposed to X rays. Thus, diffraction data are generally collected from RNA crystals at cryogenic temperatures. Compounds used in protein crystal stabilization are useful for RNA crystals as well. These include sugars and nonvolatile alcohols, such as glucose, glycerol, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), and low molecular weight polyethylene glycols (PEGs). In addition, volatile alcohols, such as ethanol and isopropanol, have been useful in RNA crystal cryostabilization. Typically, the cryoprotectant should constitute at least 15\u201320% (v/v) of the soaking solution for the crystals. Addition of the cryoprotectant should be in 1\u20132% increments by adding solution to the drop containing the crystal and resealing the coverslip to prevent evaporation.

In most CRISPR systems, the proteins Cas1 and Cas2 form the integration complex and are both essential for DNA acquisition. Most type V-C and V-D systems lack the cas2 gene and have unusually short CRISPR repeats and spacers. Here, we show that a mini-integrase comprising the type V-C Cas1 protein alone catalyzes DNA integration with a preference for short (17- to 19-base-pair) DNA fragments. The mini-integrase has weak specificity for the CRISPR array. We present evidence that the Cas1 proteins form a tetramer for integration. Our findings support a model of a minimal integrase with an internal ruler mechanism that favors shorter repeats and spacers. This minimal integrase may represent the function of \u2026"

(2006), Science, 311, 195\u2013198]. These crystals were derived from crystals that diffracted X-rays to 3.0\u2005\u00c5 resolution but were refractory to structure determination because they were twinned. It is shown here that the original Dicer crystals represent an unusual case of perfect pseudo-merohedral twinning of orthorhombic crystals. Before the twinning problem was overcome, it was possible to calculate a low-resolution electron-density map in space group P41 that was used to build a partial molecular model. Experimental phases were sufficient to identify heavy-atom sites that indicated space-group inconsistency, leading to identification of the true space group.

While individuals infected with Delta are at risk to develop severe lung disease, Omicron infection causes less severe disease, mostly upper respiratory symptoms. The question arises whether rampant spread of Omicron could lead to mass immunization, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that infection with Delta, but not Omicron, induces broad immunity in mice. While sera from Omicron-infected mice only neutralize Omicron, sera from Delta-infected mice are broadly effective against Delta and other VOCs, including Omicron. This is not observed with the WA1 ancestral strain, although both WA1 and Delta elicited a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine response and replicated to similar titers in the respiratory tracts and lungs of infected mice as well as in human airway organoids. Pulmonary viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and overall disease progression are markedly reduced with Omicron infection. Analysis of human sera from Omicron and Delta breakthrough cases reveals effective cross-variant neutralization induced by both viruses in vaccinated individuals. Together, our results indicate that Omicron infection enhances preexisting immunity elicited by vaccines, but on its own may not induce broad, cross-neutralizing humoral immunity in unvaccinated individuals."

Consequently, questions remain about their mechanisms of phage resistance and the nature of phage that infect them. The compact CRISPR-CasY system (Cas12d) with potential value in genome editing was first discovered in these organisms. Relatively few CasY sequences have been reported to date, and little is known about the function and activity of these systems in the natural environment. Here, we conducted a genome-resolved metagenomic investigation of hot spring microbiomes and recovered CRISPR systems mostly from Roizmanbacteria that involve CasY proteins that are divergent from published sequences. Within population diversity in the spacer set indicates current in situ diversification of most of the loci. In addition to CasY, some Roizmanbacteria genomes also encode large type I-B and/or III-A systems that, based on spacer targeting, are used in phage defense. CRISPR targeting identified three phage represented by complete genomes and a prophage, which are the first reported for bacteria of the Microgenomates superphylum. Interestingly, one phage encodes a Cas4-like protein, a scenario that has been suggested to drive acquisition of self-targeting spacers. Consistent with this, the Roizmanbacteria population that it infects has a CRISPR locus that includes self-targeting spacers and a fragmented CasY gene (fCasY). Despite gene fragmentation, the PAM sequence is the same as that of other CasY reported in this study. Fragmentation of CasY may avoid the \u2026"

Some of these advances have also raised important ethical and societal issues\u2013for example, about the use of recombinant DNA technologies or embryonic stem cells. The scientific community has consistently recognized its responsibility to identify and confront these issues. In these cases, engagement by a range of stakeholders has led to solutions that have made it possible to obtain major benefits for human health while appropriately addressing societal issues.Fundamental research into the ways by which bacteria defend themselves against viruses has recently led to the development of powerful new techniques that make it possible to perform gene editing\u2013that is, precisely altering genetic sequences\u2013in living cells, including those of humans, at much higher accuracy and efficiency than ever before possible. These techniques are already in broad use in biomedical research. They may also enable wide-ranging clinical applications in medicine. At the same time, the prospect of human genome editing raises many important scientific, ethical, and societal questions."

Nonetheless, each time the scope of scientific progress and the state of the field is appraised, it is followed in rapid succession by another wave of seemingly momentous developments. Each of these rounds of advances pushes at the boundaries of what can be done to the DNA within cells and organisms, expands the number of systems that can be used to engineer genomes, and increases the resolution of our understanding of how these systems work. This is also true for the articles included in this special issue of Genome Biology that is focused on genome editing, which provide important new insights in each of these areas. The clear takeaway from this collection is that the recent flurry of progress and excitement around genome editing marks only the beginning. Even greater challenges lie ahead for refining and applying these new technologies, interpreting their results, and deciding in what capacity they should be used.The most sophisticated biotechnologies continue to emerge from the seemingly most simplistic organisms. Similar to the repurposing of green fluorescent protein from jellyfish for imaging studies or small interfering RNAs from worms for gene knockdown applications, the adoption of the CRISPR/Cas9 system from prokaryotes has enabled genome editing for the broad scientific community [1]. Despite the massive impact that the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 system has had directly on genome editing, it has also shone a light into the depths \u2026"

They are found in fungal mitochondria, chloroplasts, nuclear genes of ciliates, and T-even bacteriophages. The ability to compare widely differing sequences has been a great help in studies of the secondary structure of these introns.

Upon infection, short sequences from the phage genome, known as spacers, are inserted between the CRISPR repeats. Spacers are transcribed into small RNA molecules that guide nucleases to their targets. The forces that shape the distribution of newly acquired spacers, which is observed to be uneven, are poorly understood. We studied the spacer patterns that arise after phage infection of Staphylococcus aureus harboring the Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A CRISPR-Cas system. We observed that spacer patterns are established early during the CRISPR-Cas immune response and correlate with spacer acquisition rates, but not with spacer targeting efficiency. The rate of spacer acquisition depended on sequence elements within the spacer, which in turn determined the abundance of different spacers within the adapted population. Our results \u2026"

Point mutations in EF-G suppress deleterious effects of 4.5S RNA depletion, as do mutations in the EF-G binding site within ribosomal RNA, suggesting that 4.5S RNA might play a critical role in ribosome function in addition to its role in SRP. Here we show that 4.5S RNA and EF-G form a phylogenetically conserved, low-affinity but highly specific complex involving sequence elements required for 4.5S binding to its cognate SRP protein, Ffh. Mutational analysis indicates that the same molecular structure of 4.5S RNA is \u2026"

Cas13a and Cas12a enzymes bound to CRISPR RNA (crRNA) recognize specific nucleic acid targets, initiating cleavage of the targets as well as non-target (trans) nucleic acids. Here, we examine the kinetics of single-turnover target and multi-turnover trans-nuclease activities of both enzymes. High-turnover, non-specific Cas13a trans-RNase activity is coupled to rapid binding of target RNA. By contrast, low-turnover Cas12a trans-nuclease activity is coupled to relatively slow cleavage of target DNA, selective for DNA over RNA, indifferent to base identity, and preferential for single-stranded substrates. Combining multiple crRNA increases detection sensitivity of targets, an approach we use to quantify pathogen DNA in samples from patients suspected of Buruli ulcer disease \u2026"

Extant, multidomain proteins are hypothesized to be the result of domain accretion, but there has been limited experimental validation of this idea. Here, we introduce a technique for genetic minimization by iterative size-exclusion and recombination (MISER) for comprehensively making all possible deletions of a protein. Using MISER, we generate a deletion landscape for the CRISPR protein Cas9. We find that the catalytically-dead Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 can tolerate large single deletions in the REC2, REC3, HNH, and RuvC domains, while still functioning in vitro and in vivo, and that these deletions can be stacked together to engineer minimal, DNA-binding effector proteins. In total, our results demonstrate that extant proteins retain significant modularity from the accretion process and, as genetic size is a major limitation \u2026"

TERT promoter mutations create a binding site for a GA binding protein (GABP) transcription factor complex, whose assembly at the promoter is associated with TERT reactivation and telomere maintenance. Here, we demonstrate increased binding of a specific GABPB1L-isoform\u2013containing complex to the mutant TERT promoter. Furthermore, we find that TERT promoter mutant GBM cells, unlike wild-type cells, exhibit a critical near-term dependence on GABPB1L for proliferation, notably also posttumor establishment in vivo. Up-regulation of the protein paralogue GABPB2, which is normally expressed at very low levels, can rescue this dependence. More importantly, when combined with frontline temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, inducible GABPB1L knockdown and the \u2026"

                "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided DNA targeting enzymes that bind and cut DNA as components of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a can be used as a powerful genome editing tool based on its ability to induce genetic changes in cells at sites of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cuts. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes robust, non-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity in Cas12a sufficient to completely degrade both linear and circular ssDNA molecules within minutes. This activity, catalyzed by the same active site responsible for site-specific dsDNA cutting, indiscriminately shreds ssDNA with rapid multiple-turnover cleavage kinetics. Activation of ssDNA cutting requires faithful recognition of a DNA target sequence matching the 20-nucleotide guide RNA sequence with specificity sufficient to distinguish between closely related viral serotypes. We find that target-dependent ssDNA degradation, not observed for CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes, is a fundamental property of type V CRISPR-Cas12 proteins, revealing a fascinating parallel with the RNA-triggered general RNase activity of the type VI CRISPR-Cas13 enzymes.Cas12a (Cpf1) and related type V CRISPR interference proteins possess non-specific, single-stranded DNase activity upon activation by guide RNA-dependent DNA binding."

In all cases, specific and non\u2010specific magnesium ion binding accompanies folding into the active structure. Whether similar RNA\u2013RNA and RNA\u2013magnesium ion contacts play related functional roles in different introns is not clear, particularly since it can be difficult to distinguish interactions directly involved in catalysis from those important for RNA folding.

Target capture requires Cas9 to unwind DNA at candidate sequences using an unknown ATP-independent mechanism. Here we show that Cas9 sharply bends and undertwists DNA on PAM binding, thereby flipping DNA nucleotides out of the duplex and toward the guide RNA for sequence interrogation. Cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Cas9\u2013RNA\u2013DNA complexes trapped at different states of the interrogation pathway, together with solution conformational probing, reveal that global protein rearrangement accompanies formation of an unstacked DNA hinge.

The human DEAD\u2010box protein DDX3 is implicated in diverse biological processes including translation initiation and is mutated in numerous cancers. Like many DEAD\u2010box proteins, DDX3 is essential to cellular health and exhibits dosage sensitivity, such that both decreases and increases in protein levels can be lethal. Therefore, chemical inhibition would be an ideal tool to probe the function of DDX3.

Although their active sites and RNA binding regions are functionally conserved, the helicase domains have distinct activities in the context of different Dicer enzymes. To examine the evolutionary origins of Dicer helicase functions, we investigated two related Dicer enzymes from the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile. RNA cleavage assays showed that S. thermophile Dicer-1 (StDicer-1) can process hairpin precursor microRNAs, whereas StDicer-2 can only cleave linear double-stranded RNAs. Furthermore, only StDicer-2 possesses robust ATP hydrolytic activity in the presence of double-stranded RNA. Deletion of the StDicer-2 helicase domain increases both StDicer-2 cleavage activity and affinity for hairpin RNA. Notably, both StDicer-1 and StDicer-2 could \u2026"

To investigate how the hypercompact enzyme recognizes and cleaves double-stranded DNA, we determined cryo-EM structures of Cas\u03a6 (Cas12j) in pre- and post-DNA-binding states. The structures reveal a streamlined protein architecture that tightly encircles the CRISPR RNA and DNA target to capture, unwind and cleave DNA. Comparison of the pre- and post-DNA-binding states reveals how the protein rearranges for DNA cleavage upon target recognition. On the basis of these structures, we created and tested mutant forms of Cas\u03a6 that cut DNA up to 20-fold faster relative to wild type, showing how this system may be naturally attenuated to improve the fidelity of DNA interference. The structural and mechanistic insights into how Cas\u03a6 binds and cleaves DNA should \u2026"

As a consequence, many US universities developed asymptomatic surveillance testing labs, to augment NPIs and control outbreaks on campus throughout the 2020\u20132021 academic year (AY); several of those labs continue to support asymptomatic surveillance efforts on campus in AY2021\u20132022. At the height of the pandemic, we built a stochastic branching process model of COVID-19 dynamics at UC Berkeley to advise optimal control strategies in a university environment. Our model combines behavioral interventions in the form of group size limits to deter superspreading, symptom-based isolation, and contact tracing, with \u2026"

Rabbit reticulocyte lysate conditions were optimized to faithfully report on authentic HCV IRES-dependent translation relative to a 5\u2032 capped mRNA control. The authors screened a library of ~430,000 small molecules for IRES inhibition, leading to ~1700 initial hits. After secondary counterscreening, the vast majority of hits proved to be luciferase and general translation inhibitors. Despite well-optimized in vitro translation conditions, in the end, the authors found no selective HCV IRES inhibitors but did discover a new scaffold of general translation inhibitor.

Multiple saliva-based viral detection protocols use a direct-to-RT-qPCR approach that eliminates nucleic acid extraction but can reduce viral RNA detection sensitivity. To improve test sensitivity while maintaining speed, we developed a robotic nucleic acid extraction method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples with high throughput. Using this assay, the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (IGI FAST) research study on the UC Berkeley campus conducted 11,971 tests on supervised self-collected saliva samples and identified rare positive specimens containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA during a time of low infection prevalence. In an attempt to increase testing capacity, we further adapted our robotic extraction assay to process pooled saliva samples. We also benchmarked our assay against nasopharyngeal swab specimens and found saliva methods require further optimization to match this gold standard. Finally, we designed and validated a RT-qPCR test suitable for saliva self-collection. These results establish a robotic extraction-based procedure for rapid PCR-based saliva testing that is suitable for samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals."

Therefore, if the N\u2013P bond is resistant to nucleolytic cleavage, these analogs may be effective substrate analog inhibitors of certain enzymes that hydrolyze RNA. We have explored the ability of the Tetrahymena group I intron ribozyme to bind and cleave DNA and RNA phosphoramidate analogs.Results: The Tetrahymena group I ribozyme efficiently binds to phosphoramidate oligonucleotides but is unable to cleave the N3\u2032\u2013P5\u2032 bond. Although it adopts an A-form helical structure, the deoxyribo-phosphoramidate analog, like DNA, does not dock efficiently into the ribozyme catalytic core. In contrast, the ribo-phosphoramidate analog docks similarly to the native RNA substrate, and behaves as a competitive \u2026"

We paired this workflow, termed Diagnostics with Coronavirus Enzymatic Reporting (DISCoVER), with extraction-free sample lysis using shelf-stable reagents that are widely available at low cost. DISCoVER has been validated on saliva samples to incentivize frequent testing for more widespread community surveillance and robustly detected attomolar levels of SARS-CoV-2 within 30 minutes, while avoiding false positives in virus-negative saliva. Furthermore, DISCoVER is compatible with multiplexed CRISPR probes to enable simultaneous detection of a human gene control or alternative pathogens."

The mechanisms by which these initiation factors promote ribosome conformational changes during stages of initiation have been studied using cross-linking, footprinting, site-directed probing, cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, fluorescence spectroscopy and single-molecule techniques.

In this case, differential spacing of tandem target sites creates response element diversity by producing binding sites for a range of hormone receptor homodimers and heterodimers. Two recent crystal structures of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) bound to DNA reveal that the protein\u2013protein dimer contacts form exclusively at the minor groove of the spacer between the recognition elements. The length of the spacer, typically between one and five base pairs, governs the protein\u2013protein contacts that can form. Consequently, protein dimerization occurs only in the presence of the appropriate DNA response element. Furthermore, the pattern of site selectivity based on target spacing implies that the signaling pathways of different hormones could be interchanged simply by adding or removing single base pairs from the spacing of the target site repeats.General and sequence-specific transcriptional regulation involves large multicomponent complexes that interact with RNA polymerase II. Together with recently determined crystal structures of RNA polymerase, low-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of the multisubunit transcription factor TFIID provide a basis for understanding the dynamic arrangement of factors during transcription initiation. The horseshoe-shaped structure of TFIID contains a deep groove large enough to accommodate a DNA duplex and antibody tagging has revealed the positions of specific factors within the complex. The X-ray structure of the double bromodomain from the TAFII250 component of TFIID calls attention to the possible \u2026"

In recent years, that goal has been realized to varying degrees through a number of techniques, including the use of tyrosinase-based coupling strategies. Early publications utilizing tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus(abTYR) showed the potential to convert tyrosine residues into ortho-quinone functional groups, but this enzyme is challenging to produce recombinantly and suffers from some limitations in substrate scope. Initial screens of several tyrosinase candidates revealed that the tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (megaTYR) is an enzyme that possesses a broad substrate tolerance. We use the expanded substrate preference as a starting point for protein design experiments and show that single point mutants of megaTYR are capable of activating tyrosine residues in various sequence contexts. We leverage this new \u2026"

In bacteria, RNA molecules that guide Cas9\u2032s activity derive from foreign DNA fragments that are captured and integrated into the host CRISPR genomic locus by the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR integrase. How cells generate the specific lengths of DNA required for integrase capture is a central unanswered question of type II-A CRISPR-based adaptive immunity. Here, we show that an integrase supercomplex comprising guide RNA and the proteins Cas1, Cas2, Csn2 and Cas9 generates precisely trimmed 30-base pair DNA molecules required for genome integration. The HNH active site of Cas9 catalyzes exonucleolytic DNA trimming by a mechanism that is independent of the guide RNA sequence. These results show that Cas9 possesses a \u2026"

However only a few Cas13 homologs have been shown to mediate robust RNA targeting in human cells, suggesting that unknown elements may be limiting their efficacy. Furthermore, many Cas13 enzymes show high degrees of toxicity upon targeting and have not been shown to mediate specific knockdown in other cell types such as E. coli. Here, we show that catalytically inactive Cas13 enzymes can be repurposed for efficient translational repression in bacteria with no associated growth defects. To achieve this advance, we carried out a directed evolution screen to engineer functional Cas13a variants, and identified a number of stabilizing mutations, which enabled efficient post transcriptional knockdown of gene expression. In vitro characterization of the resulting engineered Lbu Cas13a mutant, termed eLbu, revealed both stabilization and altered cleavage kinetics. Finally, we show that eLbu can be used for efficient exon skipping in human cells. This work represents the first demonstration of targeted translational repression in E. coli using a CRISPR enzyme, as well as the first directed evolution of a Cas13 enzyme. Such a platform could allow for engineering other aspects of this protein family to obtain more robust RNA targeting tools."

Previously, we reported an ATP-independent diffusion of transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP) on dsRNA, yet the mechanistic details remain elusive. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays, we demonstrate that the diffusion activity of TRBP is coordinated by an independent movement of two subdomains, dsRBD1 and dsRBD2, in which the diffusion distance is determined by the length of a flexible linker domain that connects the two dsRBDs. When the linker is shortened, the diffusion distance is reduced proportionally, suggesting a ruler-like function of the linker domain. Diffusion stalls upon encountering a physical barrier in the form of an RNA:DNA hybrid segment or bulky secondary structures, indicating a dsRNA scanning mode of TRBP. The results \u2026"

Key components of the defense system are ribonucleoprotein complexes, the composition of which appears highly variable in different CRISPR/Cas subtypes. Previous studies combined mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and small angle x-ray scattering to demonstrate that the E. coli Cascade complex (405 kDa) and the P. aeruginosa Csy-complex (350 kDa) are similar in that they share a central spiral-shaped hexameric structure, flanked by associating proteins and one CRISPR RNA. Recently, a cryo-electron microscopy structure of Cascade revealed that the CRISPR RNA molecule resides in a groove of the hexameric backbone. For both complexes we here describe the use of native mass spectrometry in combination with ion mobility mass spectrometry to assign a stable core surrounded by more loosely associated modules. Via computational modeling subcomplex structures were proposed that relate to the experimental IMMS data. Despite the absence of obvious sequence homology between several subunits, detailed analysis of sub-complexes strongly suggests analogy between subunits of the two complexes. Probing the specific association of E. coli Cascade/crRNA to its complementary DNA target reveals a conformational change. All together these findings provide relevant new information about the potential assembly process of the two CRISPR-associated complexes."

To elucidate how the RT-integrase organizes distinct enzymatic activities, we present the cryo-EM structure of a Cas6-RT-Cas1\u2014Cas2 CRISPR integrase complex. The structure reveals a heterohexamer in which the RT directly contacts the integrase and maturase domains, suggesting functional coordination between all three active sites.

In studying groundwater, sediments, and wetland soil where methane production and oxidation occur, we discovered extraordinarily large, diverse DNA sequences that primarily encode hypothetical proteins. Four curated, complete genomes are linear, up to ~1 Mbp in length and share genome organization, including replicore structure, long inverted terminal repeats, and genome-wide unique perfect tandem direct repeats that are intergenic or generate amino acid repeats. We infer that these are a new type of archaeal extrachromosomal element with a distinct evolutionary origin. Gene sequence similarity, phylogeny, and local divergence of sequence composition indicate that many of their genes were assimilated from methane-oxidizing Methanoperedens archaea. We refer to these elements as \"Borgs\". We identified at least 19 different Borg types coexisting with Methanoperedens in four distinct ecosystems. Borg genes expand redox and respiratory capacity (e.g., clusters of multiheme cytochromes), ability to respond to changing environmental conditions, and likely augment Methanoperedens capacity for methane oxidation (e.g., methyl coenzyme M reductase). By this process, Borgs could play a previously unrecognized role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."

Their discovery not only provided insight regarding the molecular basis of reproduction of the genetic material, but also led to an intense effort to understand how the information encoded in DNA was expressed. 1, 2 Of course, it was this latter line of inquiry that led to what for many of us is an even more interesting nucleic acid, RNA.Like DNA, RNA can form a double helix with two polynucleotide strands held together by complementary base pairs. However, in nature RNA is most often a single-stranded molecule. Not locked into a duplex, it is free to assume any of a variety of structures. These structures include (1) intramolecular helices capped by hairpin loops;(2) interactions of these loops, including pseudoknots and tetraloop-helix minor groove interactions;(3) additional base pairs, triples and in some cases tetrads;(4) structured internal loops; and (5) undoubtedly a host of as-yet-unknown tertiary interactions. 3-8 In addition ribonucleic acid has a hydrogen bonding moiety not found in DNA, the 2\u2019OH. As will be discussed herein, this functional group may provide one of the keys for a nucleic acid to be able to form a specific tertiary structure from what would otherwise be a loose collection of helical elements. 9, 10 Some RNA molecules use combinations of these structural elements to form specific, stable catalytic centers for biochemical reactions. The existence of such ribozymes has been known since the finding of a self-splicing intron and the catalytic RNA subunit of RNase P a decade ago.. 11, 12 In the \u2026"

Recent direct detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas13a1\u20134 avoid reverse transcription and DNA amplification required of gold-standard PCR assays5, but these assays have not yet achieved the sensitivity of PCR and are not easily multiplexed to detect multiple viruses or variants. Here we show that Cas13a acting on single target RNAs loaded into droplets exhibits stochastic nuclease activity that can be used to enable sensitive, rapid, and multiplexed virus quantification. Using SARS-CoV-2 RNA as the target and combinations of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that recognize different parts of the viral genome, we demonstrate that reactions confined to small volumes can rapidly achieve PCR-level sensitivity. By tracking nuclease activity within individual droplets over time, we find that Cas13a exhibits rich kinetic behavior that depends on both the target RNA and crRNA. We demonstrate that these kinetic signatures can be harnessed to differentiate between different human coronavirus species as well as SARS-CoV-2 variants within a single droplet. The combination of high sensitivity, short reaction times, and multiplexing makes this droplet-based Cas13a assay with kinetic barcoding a promising strategy for direct RNA identification and quantification."

Given that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) derive their energy from host cells, we investigated the diversity of ATP-utilizing proteins in MGE genomes to determine whether they might be associated with proteins that could suppress related host proteins that consume energy. A comprehensive search of 353 huge phage genomes revealed that up to 9% of the proteins have ATPase domains. For example, ATPase proteins constitute\u223c 3% of the genomes of Lak phages with\u223c 550 kbp genomes that occur in the microbiomes of humans and other animals. Statistical analysis shows the number of ATPase proteins increases linearly with genome length, consistent with a large sink for host ATP during replication of megaphages. Using metagenomic data from diverse environments, we found 505 mobilome proteins with ATPase domains \u2026"

Although it can induce RNA-guided genome editing in mammalian cells, the activity of CasX is less robust than that of the widely used S. pyogenes Cas9. Here, we show that structural features of two CasX homologs and their guide RNAs affect the R-loop complex assembly and DNA cleavage activity. Cryo-EM-based structural engineering of either the CasX protein or the guide RNA produced two new CasX genome editors (DpbCasX-R3-v2 and PlmCasX-R1-v2) with significantly improved DNA manipulation efficacy. These results advance both the mechanistic understanding of CasX and its application as a genome-editing tool."

Here, we report a microfluidic platform for point-of-care, CRISPR-based molecular diagnostics. We first developed a nucleic acid test which pairs distinct mechanisms of DNA and RNA amplification optimized for high sensitivity and rapid kinetics, linked to Cas13 detection for specificity. We combined this workflow with an extraction-free sample lysis protocol using shelf-stable reagents that are widely available at low cost, and a multiplexed human gene control for calling negative test results. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate sensitivity down to 40 copies/\u03bcL of SARS-CoV-2 in unextracted saliva within 35 minutes, and validated the test on total RNA extracted from patient nasal swabs with a range of qPCR Ct values from 13\u201335.

However, variations in CPR/DPANN organism abundance, distribution, taxonomic diversity, and degree/nature of host association with groundwater chemistry remain understudied. Here, we performed genome-resolved metagenomic characterization of one agriculturally-impacted and seven pristine groundwater microbial communities in California, recovering 746 dereplicated CPR and DPANN genomes. Our finding of up to 31% CPR bacteria and 4% DPANN archaea in the pristine sites, which serve as local sources of drinking water, may hold health relevance, given growing awareness of the presence of CPR/DPANN organisms in human microbiomes and their association with disease. There is little species-level genome overlap across groundwater sites, indicating that CPR and DPANN communities are highly differentiated according to host populations and physicochemical conditions. Cryo-TEM imaging and genomic analyses indicate that CPR growth may be stimulated by attachment to the surface of host cells, and identified CPR and DPANN lineages with particularly prevalent and/or resilient host cell attachment. These results establish the huge but site-specific diversity of CPR bacteria and DPANN archaea coexisting with diverse hosts in groundwater aquifers, and raise important questions about potential impacts on human health."

DNA cleavage of Cas9 is controlled by the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain, but the mechanism that governs HNH activation at on-target DNA while reducing cleavage activity at off-target sites remains poorly understood. Using single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), we identified an intermediate state of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, representing a conformational checkpoint between DNA binding and cleavage. Upon DNA binding, the HNH domain transitions between multiple conformations before docking into its active state. We showed that the high-fidelity (SpCas9-HF1) and enhanced specificity (eSpCas9 (1.1)) Cas9 variants are trapped in an inactive state when bound to mismatched targets.

To analyze Cas9\u2032s ability to bind DNA rapidly and specifically, we measured the kinetics of catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) interactions with a library of potential binding partners. Using a massively parallel assay of protein-DNA interactions derived from a high-throughput sequencing flow cell (HiTS-FLIP) and building on the established importance of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and seed recognition, we identify two PAM-distal regions, proximal and distal to the seed region, with distinct behaviors: multiple mismatches in the seed-proximal region work in a highly synergistic manner to reduce Cas9 association whereas seemingly tolerated mismatches in the distal region precipitate comparatively rapid dissociation of Cas9. Together, these observations support a model for Cas9 specificity wherein gRNA-DNA mismatches at distinct domains of PAM-distal bases modulate different biophysical parameters of association and dissociation, opening the possibility of kinetic and thermodynamic tuning of the Cas9-DNA interaction and quantitative prediction of off-target binding behaviors."

                "abstract": "RNAs and in vitro selection approaches were an exciting new frontier. The first scientific meeting one of us (JAD) attended was the 52nd Cold Spring Harbor Symposium (CSHS) on the Evolution of Catalysts in the spring of 1987. It was a spectacular experience: attendees at the meeting were abuzz with the excitement and novelty of ribozymes and the mechanisms of chemical reactions critical for life. Ample time to mingle with colleagues fostered many conversations about the details and unanticipated connections among the systems we were each studying. Almost 20 years later, the world of functional RNAs is no less exciting. This year\u2019s 71st CSHS on Regulatory RNAs, held May 31\u2013June 5, 2006, in Cold Spring Harbor, NY, discussed novel aspects of RNA biology that we are only beginning to understand. Focused largely, though not exclusively, on RNA interference (RNAi), the meeting brought together a diverse group of scientists broadly interested in understanding how, where, when, and why RNA molecules have evolved to regulate gene expression in a wide variety of ways in cells and viruses. Although the pathways and molecular players involved in RNA-mediated gene regulation are being elucidated at a rapid pace, the chemical and mechanistic underpinnings remain to be worked out. The underlying molecular mechanisms, and the possibilities for tapping these processes for therapeutic purposes, fall squarely into the realm of chemical biology."

Systematic attempts to genetically or biochemically define these host factors have yielded hundreds of candidates, but few have been functionally validated in primary cells. Here, we target 426 genes previously implicated in the HIV lifecycle through protein interaction studies for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-out in primary human CD4+ T cells in order to systematically assess their functional roles in HIV replication. We achieve efficient knockout (>50% of alleles) in 364 of the targeted genes and identify 86 candidate host factors that alter HIV infection. 47 of these factors validate by multiplex gene editing in independent donors, including 23 factors with restrictive activity. Both gene editing efficiencies and HIV-1 phenotypes are highly concordant among independent donors. Importantly, over half of these factors have not been \u2026"

DNA origami structures, where long single-stranded DNA is folded into a compact nanostructure, present an attractive approach to package genes; however, effective delivery of genetic material into cell nuclei has remained a critical challenge. Here, we describe the use of DNA nanostructures encoding an intact human gene and a fluorescent protein encoding gene as compact templates for gene integration by CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). Our design includes CRISPR\u2013Cas9 ribonucleoprotein binding sites on DNA nanostructures to increase shuttling into the nucleus. We demonstrate efficient shuttling and genomic integration of DNA nanostructures using transfection and electroporation. These nanostructured templates display lower toxicity and higher insertion efficiency compared to unstructured double \u2026"

Our results show that the 13-subunit complex can be maintained intact in the gas phase, enabling us to establish unambiguously its stoichiometry and its overall subunit architecture via tandem mass spectrometry and solution disruption experiments. Dissociation takes place as a function of ionic strength to form three stable modules eIF3 (c: d: e: l: k), eIF3 (f: h: m), and eIF3 (a: b: i: g). These modules are linked by interactions between subunits eIF3b: c and eIF3c: h. We confirmed our interaction map with the homologous yeast eIF3 complex that contains the five core subunits found in the human eIF3 and supplemented our data with results from \u2026"

Although most modern enzymes are proteins, the discovery of a few classes of naturally occurring catalytic RNAs, called ribozymes, greatly enhances the credibility of speculation that nucleic acids were the original biocatalysts, in part because RNA plays central roles in the fundamental process of protein biosynthesis in all cells. According to the \u201cRNA World\u201d hypothesis, RNA once both encoded genetic information and possessed the ability to replicate that information faithfully, as well as to catalyze the synthesis of essential chemical building blocks (Joyce 1989). As this primitive RNA-based metabolism evolved, requirements for more sophisticated biocatalysts are thought to have stimulated the transition to protein enzymes. Ribozymes present in viruses and organisms ranging from bacteria to humans may be holdovers from such an RNA-dominated era. If this is true, a subset of catalytic activities performed by modern protein enzymes was originally part of the repertoire of ribozymes.Since the initial discoveries of ribozymes in the early 1980s, much effort has focused on determining how these catalysts achieve exquisite substrate speci\ufb01city and impressive rate enhancements despite lacking the diversity of functional groups present in proteins. Over the past decade, molecular structures of several ribozymes and their component domains have been determined by X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, revealing how even small RNAs can form complex three-dimensional"

These RNAs, or ribozymes, seemed likely to have defined three-dimensional conformations analogous to the structures required for the enzymatic activity of proteins. Since the only RNA structures known at atomic resolution were transfer RNAs and simple duplexes, however, the detailed architecture of an RNA active site was a mystery. Thus, great excitement has been generated by the recently reported crystal structure of a hammerhead ribozyme by David McKay and coworkers at Stanford University [1].The hammerhead motif is a self-cleaving RNA structure that occurs within the genomes of various plant viroids and virusoids and probably facilitates rolling-circle replication of these infectious agents [2]. The secondary structure of the RNA consists of three base-paired \u2026"

Furthermore, multiplexed RT-qPCR tests that detect at least two SARS-CoV-2 genes in a single reaction are typically not affordable for large scale clinical surveillance or adaptable to multiple PCR machines and plate layouts. We developed a RT-qPCR assay using the Luna Probe Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix with publicly available primers and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2 N gene, E gene, and human RNase P (LuNER) to address these shortcomings and meet the testing demands of a university campus and the local community. This cost-effective test is compatible with BioRad or Applied Biosystems qPCR machines, in 96 and 384-well formats, with or without sample pooling, and has a detection sensitivity suitable for both clinical reporting and wastewater surveillance efforts."

SARS-CoV-2 has a robust person-to-person transmission rate and an asymptomatic period of two weeks or more, leading to widespread infection that has overwhelmed healthcare infrastructures around the globe. Effective public health measures require extensive, accurate, and rapid testing to determine infection rates. Here we describe the strategy we used to establish a CLIA-licensed clinical laboratory to perform a validated Laboratory-Developed Test (LDT) for SARS-CoV-2 in Berkeley, California and the surrounding Bay Area community. Our procedures for implementing the technical, regulatory, and data management workstreams necessary for clinical sample processing provide a roadmap to aid others in setting up similar testing centers.in accordance with established virology and infectious disease nomenclature, throughout this document we use \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d to refer to the viral agent causing infection and \u201cCOVID-19\u201d to refer to the human infectious disease caused by that viral agent."

Here we present a third and fundamentally distinct RNA-guided platform, CRISPR-CasX, which uses a unique structure and mechanism for programmable double-stranded DNA cleavage. Biochemical and in vivo data demonstrate that CasX is active for E. coli and human genome modification. Eight cryo-EM structures of CasX in different states of assembly with its guide RNA and double-stranded DNA substrates reveal an extensive RNA scaffold and an unanticipated domain required for DNA unwinding. These data demonstrate how CasX activity arose through convergent evolution to establish an enzyme family that is functionally separate from both Cas9 and Cas12a."

We show here that the native activity of CRISPR-Cas12c protects bacteria from phage infection by binding to DNA targets without cleaving them, revealing that antiviral interference can be accomplished without chemical attack on the invader or general metabolic disruption in the host. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that Cas12c is a site-specific ribonuclease capable of generating mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from precursor transcripts. Furthermore, we find that crRNA maturation is essential for Cas12c-mediated DNA targeting. These crRNAs direct double-stranded DNA binding by Cas12c using a mechanism that precludes DNA cutting. Nevertheless, Cas12c represses transcription and can defend bacteria against lytic bacteriophage infection when targeting \u2026"

                "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas13 proteins are RNA-guided RNA nucleases that defend against invasive phages through general, non-specific RNA degradation upon complementary target transcript binding. Despite being RNA nucleases, Cas13 effectors are capable of inhibiting the infection of dsDNA phages but have only been investigated across a relatively small sampling of phage diversity. Here, we employ a systematic, phage-centric approach to determine the anti-phage capacity of Cas13 and find LbuCas13a to be a remarkably potent phage inhibitor. LbuCas13a confers robust, consistent antiviral activity regardless of gene essentiality, gene expression timing or target sequence location. Furthermore, after challenging LbuCas13a with eight diverse E. coli phages distributed across E. coli phage phylogenetic groups, we find no apparent phage-encoded limits to its potent antiviral activity. In contrast to other Class 2 CRISPR-Cas proteins, these results suggest that DNA phages are generally vulnerable to Cas13a targeting. Leveraging this effective anti-phage activity, LbuCas13a can be used seamlessly as a counter-selection agent for broad-spectrum phage editing. Using a two-step phage editing and enrichment approach, we show that LbuCas13a enables markerless genome edits in phages with exceptionally high efficiency and precision, including edits as small as a single codon. By taking advantage of the broad vulnerability of RNA during viral infection, Cas13a enables a generalizable strategy for editing the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth."

Currently, no test combines detection of widely used SARS-CoV-2 E-and N-gene targets and a sample control in a single, multiplexed reaction. We developed the IGI-LuNER RT-qPCR assay using the Lu na Probe Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix with publicly available primers and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2 N gene, E gene, and human RNase P (NER). This combined, cost-effective test can be performed in 384-well plates with detection sensitivity suitable for clinical reporting, and will aid in future sample pooling efforts, thus improving throughput of SARS-CoV-2 detection."

Although we agree with Nathamgari et al.(2) on the simplicity of the nanopore-electroporation system in allowing for an easy adaptation of the technology by the biological research community, the advantages of using the nanostraw system (4, 5) and single nanochannels (6) for uniform dosage control delivery could not be ignored, which would advance the discoveries in the biomedical research community.Regarding the so-called minor lapse that Nathamgari et al.(2) mention in the letter, the up to 50% transfection efficiency was reported in the 2014 paper (7) that we have cited \u2026"

                "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 is the state-of-the-art technology for editing and manipulating nucleic acids. However, the occurrence of off-target mutations can limit its applicability. Here, all-atom enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations \u2013 using Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) \u2013 are used to decipher the mechanism of off-target binding at the molecular level. GaMD reveals that base pair mismatches in the target DNA at specific distal sites with respect to the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) induce an extended opening of the RNA:DNA heteroduplex, which leads to newly discovered interactions between the unwound nucleic acids and the protein counterpart. The conserved interactions between the target DNA strand and the L2 loop of the catalytic HNH domain constitute a \u201clock\u201d effectively decreasing the conformational freedom of the HNH domain and its activation for cleavage. Remarkably, depending on their position at PAM distal sites, DNA mismatches leading to off-target cleavages are unable to \u201clock\u201d the HNH domain, thereby identifying the ability to \u201clock\u201d HNH as a key determinant. Consistently, off-target sequences hampering the catalysis have been shown to \u201ctrap\u201d somehow the HNH domain in an inactive \u201cconformational checkpoint\u201d state (Dagdas et al. Sci Adv, 2017). As such, this mechanism identifies the molecular basis underlying off-target cleavages and contributes in clarifying a long-lasting open issue of the CRISPR-Cas9 function. It also poses the foundation for designing novel and more specific Cas9 variants, which could be obtained by magnifying the \u201clocking\u201d interactions between HNH and the target DNA in the presence of any \u2026"

A major determinant of species tropism is the influenza polymerase subunit PB2. We show here that a dominant inhibitory activity in human cells potently and selectively restricts the function of polymerase containing an avian-like PB2 with glutamic acid at residue 627. This inhibitory activity dramatically reduces virus production by polymerases containing PB2 K627E without reducing their relative infectivity. Restricted polymerases fail to assemble into ribonucleoprotein complexes, resulting in decreased genome transcription, replication, and virus production. However, both wild-type and mutant PB2 bind to viral nucleoprotein when expressed alone, suggesting that species-specific conformational alterations within the polymerase trimer disrupt \u2026"

The reviews in this issue of Current Opinion in Structural Biology discuss some of the most fundamental aspects of RNA folding and dynamics, modes of nucleic acid recognition, and the assembly and structures of large protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes including ribosomes, nucleosomes, and spliceosomes. Many recent advances in these fields stem from structural insights gained through a combination of X-ray crystallography, NMR, electron cryo-microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and chemical and enzymatic probing. A recurrent theme in these reviews is the interplay between structure and the dynamics of macromolecular complex assembly, catalysis, and regulation.New functions of noncoding RNA in biology continue to be discovered, underscoring the unique capabilities of RNA to both encode and act upon genetic information. As Hashimi and Walter describe in the first review, these functions often require dynamic changes in both the conformation and molecular partners of RNA. Recent studies suggest that many RNA molecules, though prone to kinetic trapping of locally misfolded structures, are designed to form correct secondary structural interactions during transcription. In some cases, the capacity for conformational change is directly relevant to biological function, as in the case of riboswitches. Both single-molecule and bulk solution experiments using fluorescently labeled RNAs have illuminated the dynamics of riboswitch conformational dynamics in response to ligand binding, providing exciting insight into \u2026"

Homology-directed repair (HDR) in the presence of donor templates is currently the most versatile way to introduce precise edits following CRISPR-Cas-induced double-stranded DNA cuts, but HDR efficiency is generally low relative to end-joining pathways that lead to insertions and deletions (indels). We tested the hypothesis that HDR could be increased using a Cas9 construct fused to PRDM9, a chromatin remodeling factor that deposits histone methylations H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 shown to mediate homologous recombination in human cells. Our results show that the fusion protein contacts chromatin specifically at the Cas9 cut site in DNA to double the observed HDR efficiency and increase the HDR:indel ratio by 3-fold compared to that induced by Cas9 alone. HDR enhancement occurred in multiple cell lines with no increase in off-target genome editing. These findings underscore the importance of chromatin structure for the choice of DNA repair pathway during CRISPR-Cas genome editing and provide a new strategy to increase the efficiency of HDR."

Scientists have long envisioned the ability to change the DNA sequence in cells to correct disease-causing information. A technology known as CRISPR now enables precise rewriting of DNA sequences, offering unparalleled potential for altering the code of life in human beings as well as other organisms. CRISPR technology holds the promise of curing genetic disease and provides methods to reshape the biosphere for the benefit of human societies and the environment. However, along with these enormous opportunities come safety risks and ethical concerns.

This system brings together three major classes of biopolymers (DNA, RNA and protein), but the specificity of different components for each other remains poorly understood. Perhaps most important, Cas9 has been shown to bind and cleave genomic DNA sequences with varying degrees of mismatches to the guide RNA, leading to potentially deleterious off-target effects. Previous methods to investigate the tolerability of mismatches have largely employed experimental methods that use Cas9-induced \u2026"

Beyond the two most common point mutations, which selectively recruit the ETS factor GABP to activate TERT, the significance of other variants is unknown. In seven cancer types, we identify duplications of wildtype sequence within the core promoter region of TERT that have strikingly similar features including an ETS motif, the duplication length and insertion site. The duplications recruit a GABP tetramer by virtue of the native ETS motif and its precisely spaced duplicated counterpart, activate the promoter and are clonal in a TERT expressing multifocal glioblastoma. We conclude that recurrent TERT promoter duplications are functionally and mechanistically equivalent to the hotspot mutations that confer tumor cell immortality.

CRISPR-Cas9, the most widely used genome editor, is an RNA-guided DNA-cutting enzyme that makes double-stranded DNA breaks at preselected (on-target) positions in the DNA of living cells. 1 Repair of the break site results in either small insertions and deletions (indels) introduced by error-prone repair or insertion of a new DNA donor sequence chosen by the \u2026"

These strand exchange events involve the intersection of two geometrically distinct helix types\u2014an RNA:DNA hybrid (A-form) and a DNA:DNA homoduplex (B-form). Although previous evidence suggests that these two helices can stack on each other, it is unknown what local geometric adjustments could enable A-on-B stacking. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of an RNA-5\u2032/DNA-3\u2032 strand exchange junction at an anisotropic resolution of 1.6 to 2.2 \u00c5. The structure reveals that the A-to-B helical transition involves a combination of helical axis misalignment, helical axis tilting and compression of the DNA strand within the RNA:DNA helix, where nucleotides exhibit a mixture of A- and B-form geometry. These structural principles explain previous observations of conformational stability in RNA/DNA exchange junctions, enabling a nucleic acid architecture that is repeatedly populated during biological strand exchange events."

Enveloped delivery vehicles (EDVs), such as virus-like particles, have the potential to enable targeted genome editing by deploying the cell-type specific membrane fusion activity of viral glycoproteins for transient delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 protein and guide RNA. We previously demonstrated that displaying the HIV-1 glycoprotein on enveloped Cas9-containing particles directs genome editing exclusively to CD4+ T cells within a mixed-cell population. Inspired by chimeric antigen receptors and their ability to link programmable targeting to T cell function, we show here that displaying antibody fragments on Cas9-enveloped particles can target genome editing tools to specific cells. These Cas9-packaging enveloped delivery vehicles (Cas9-EDVs) confer genome editing in target cells over bystander cells, even when target cells are rare (~2%) in the population. By swapping the displayed antibody, different cell types within a mixture can be edited selectively. Together, antibody-targeted EDVs have the potential to enable cell-selective genome editing for therapeutic applications both ex vivo and in vivo."

In this work, we present crispr2vec: a deep metric learning approach for embedding CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences and predicting off-target cuts. Given a fixed target sequence, we show that our learned embedding yields a faithful representation of potential off-targets. We present a new triplet sampling strategy specifically for CRISPR sequences that improves the quality of our embedding. We show the resulting embedding generalizes across different off-target cut detection assays. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of our deep metric learning method in its ability to predict off-target cuts compared to previous literature in cross fold validation across different datasets for both seen and unseen sgRNAs."

CRISPR immunity begins with integration of foreign sequences into the host CRISPR genomic locus, followed by transcription and maturation of CRISPR RNAs. In a few CRISPR systems, the Cas1 integrase and a Cas6 nuclease are fused to a reverse transcriptase that enables viral sequence acquisition from both DNA and RNA sources. To determine how these components work together, we determined a 3.7 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of a Cas6-RT-Cas1 protein complexed with Cas2, a subunit of the CRISPR integrase. The structure and accompanying mutagenesis experiments provide evidence of bidirectional crosstalk between the Cas1 and RT active sites and unidirectional crosstalk from Cas6 to the Cas1 and RT active sites. Together, these findings suggest regulated structural rearrangements that may coordinate the complex\u2019s different enzymatic activities."

TERT, the catalytically active and rate-limiting subunit of telomerase, functions to maintain telomeres, which cap and protect the ends of chromosomes. Our past work has demonstrated that the transcription factor GABP-and specifically its tetramer-forming isoform GABPb1L-binds and activates the mutant TERT promoter. The generation of CRISPR-induced indels in GABPb1L results in a gradual loss of cell viability in TERT promoter mutant but not TERT promoter wild type tumor cells in vitro, but the extent to which GABPb1L function is compromised in this setting is unclear.

However, many desirable constructs cannot be produced through direct expression, and the targeted coupling of two proteins is chemically challenging. Here we present a new approach for the rapid and site-specific coupling of proteins using native amino acids. Tyrosinase oxidizes exposed tyrosine residues on polypeptides, generating ortho-quinones that react rapidly with strategically placed cysteine residues in other proteins. This approach was used to modify CRISPR-Cas9 and other substrates with small molecules, peptides and even intact proteins. The conjugation of cell penetrating peptides to CRISPR-Cas9 was shown to increase cellular genome editing efficiency by 20-fold relative to unmodified Cas9. This technology represents a new paradigm for biomolecular coupling, and paves the way to an unprecedented range of multifunctional bioconjugates."

In particular, we focus on two different network geometries of DNA strands and analyse the different fluctuations properties. We link the local and global conformational changes, and the local DNA network properties, to the binding propensity of the DNA cleaving protein HinP1I. Finally, we use the Michaelis-Menten theory to connect the binding propensity predictions with time-dependent gel electrophoresis experiments."

Consequently, questions remain about their mechanisms of phage resistance and the nature of phage that infect them. The compact CRISPR-CasY system (Cas12d) with potential value in genome editing was first discovered in these organisms. Relatively few CasY sequences have been reported to date, and little is known about the function and activity of these systems in the natural environment. Here, we conducted a genome-resolved metagenomic investigation of hot spring microbiomes and recovered CRISPR systems mostly from Roizmanbacteria that involve CasY proteins that are divergent from published sequences. Within population diversity in the spacer set indicates current in situ diversification of most of the loci. In addition to CasY, some Roizmanbacteria genomes also encode large type I-B and/or III-A systems that, based on spacer targeting, are used in phage defense. CRISPR targeting identified three phage represented by complete genomes and a prophage, which are the first reported for bacteria of the Microgenomates superphylum. Interestingly, one phage encodes a Cas4-like protein, a scenario that has been suggested to drive acquisition of self-targeting spacers. Consistent with this, the Roizmanbacteria population that it infects has a CRISPR locus that includes self-targeting spacers and a fragmented CasY gene (fCasY). Despite gene fragmentation, the PAM sequence is the same as that of other CasY reported in this study. Fragmentation of CasY may avoid \u2026"

Together with single-guide RNAs, Cas9 is also widely utilized as a programmable genome editing tool. DNA cleavage activity is controlled directly by the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain, but Cas9 conformational dynamics during DNA binding remain poorly characterized. Using single-molecule FRET assays, we identified a long-lived intermediate state of S. pyogenes Cas9. Upon DNA binding, the HNH nuclease reversibly transitions between RNA-bound, DNA-bound and docked conformations, before it docks irreversibly into its catalytically active conformation for DNA cleavage. Docking of HNH to its active state requires divalent cation, and HNH remains in the docked state after cleavage of a \u2026"

                "abstract": "In a recent paper Siegfried et al. published a new sequence-based structural RNA assay that utilizes mutational profiling to detect base pairing (MaP). Output from MaP provides information about both pairing (via reactivities) and contact (via correlations). Reactivities can be coupled to partition function folding models for structural inference, while correlations can reveal pairs of sites that may be in structural proximity. The possibility for inference of 3D contacts via MaP suggests a novel approach to structural prediction for RNA analogous to covariance structural prediction for proteins. We explore this approach and show that partial correlation analysis outperforms na\\\"ive correlation analysis. Our results should be applicable to a wide range of high-throughput sequencing based RNA structural assays that are under development."

The assembly of this ribonucleoprotein depends on the RISC-loading complex (RLC), which comprises the endoribonuclease Dicer, a dsRNA binding protein such as TRBP, and an Argonaute protein.We currently lack mechanistic details regarding the role of TRBP and its homologs in the process of RISC loading. TRBP is known to increase the stability of Dicer and promote interactions between the three protein components of the RLC. An additional hypothesized role for TRBP is to act as a chaperone that shuttles an RNA duplex from Dicer to Argonaute, potentially taking part in the process of strand selection that determines which arm of the \u2026"

It has been an extraordinary opportunity to work with so many amazing people, both in my own laboratory, with our collaborators, and, of course, with Emmanuelle. Before I even met Emmanuelle, Jill Banfield, my colleague at UC Berkeley, was one of the first researchers to find CRISPR sequences back before they were a thing. There have been so many other people since then. The science is still what gets me out of the bed every morning and is still very new and exciting. The worst? Certainly, the pandemic is high up there on my list. If there is a silver lining, it pulled together scientists from different disciplines. We certainly saw this at the IGI. People came together to build a clinical testing laboratory where we were able to build a team to develop CRISPR as a diagnostic tool. There were many other things that happened scientifically everywhere, of course, that were motivated \u2026"

CRISPRi and CRISPRa technologies have been applied extensively for programmable modulation of gene transcription, but there are few such tools for targeted modulation of protein translation rates. Here, we employ CRISPR-Cas13 as a programmable activator of translation. We develop a novel variant of the catalytically-deactivated Cas13d enzyme dCasRx by fusing it to translation initiation factor IF3. We demonstrate dCasRx-IF3\u2019s ability to enhance expression 21.3-fold above dCasRx when both are targeted to the start of the 5\u2032 untranslated region of mRNA encoding red fluorescent protein in Escherichia coli. Activation of translation is location-dependent, and we show dCasRx-IF3 represses translation when targeted to the ribosomal binding site, rather than enhancing it. We provide evidence that dCasRx-IF3 \u2026"

The route to immortality found in over 50 cancer types is mutation of the TERT promoter (TERTp) mutations. Studies in glioblastoma have shown the two most common TERTp mutations, G228A and G250A, reactivate TERT expression through de novo E26 transformation specific (ETS) site generation that, in tandem with a native TERTp ETS site, recruits the tetrameric GA-binding protein (GABP) complex formed by two GABP alpha (GABPA) subunits and two tetramer specific GABPB1 (B1) subunits, GABPB1L (B1L). While ten additional TERTp mutations have been described across cancer types, functional studies have been limited to select mutations and cancer types. We found that each de novo ETS motif generating TERTp mutation increases TERTp transcriptional activity in a GABP-dependent \u2026"

The sequence specificity of R-loop formation and cleavage has enabled wide applications in genetic engineering. R-loop substeps are affected by mismatches with the guide RNA and by target DNA topology, which must be understood to arrive at mechanochemical descriptions of the mechanisms underlying specificity in different CRISPR endonucleases. We have used rotor bead tracking (RBT), a high-resolution single-molecule torque spectroscopy method, to observe the dynamics of R-loop formation on supercoiled DNA. By observing torque changes corresponding to DNA duplex unwinding, we can measure the dynamics and mechanics of DNA interrogation. We quantify torque-dependent transition rates \u2026"

Here, we used global proteomic and genomic analyses during infection to understand the molecular responses driving VOC evolution. We discovered VOC-specific differences in viral RNA and protein expression levels, including for N, Orf6, and Orf9b, and pinpointed several viral mutations responsible. An analysis of the host response to VOC infection and comprehensive interrogation of altered virus-host protein-protein interactions revealed conserved and divergent regulation of biological pathways. For example, regulation of host translation was highly conserved, consistent with suppression of VOC replication in mice using the translation inhibitor plitidepsin. Conversely, modulation of the host inflammatory response was most divergent, where we found Alpha and Beta, but not Omicron BA.1, antagonized interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), a phenotype that correlated with differing levels of Orf6. Additionally, Delta more strongly upregulated proinflammatory genes compared to other VOCs. Systematic comparison of Omicron subvariants revealed BA.5 to have evolved enhanced ISG and proinflammatory gene suppression that similarly correlated with Orf6 expression, effects not seen in BA.4 due to a mutation that disrupts the Orf6-nuclear pore interaction. Our findings describe how VOCs have evolved to fine-tune viral protein expression and protein-protein interactions to evade both innate and adaptive immune responses, offering a likely explanation for increased transmission in humans."

                "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas12a is an RNA-guided, programmable genome editing enzyme found within bacterial adaptive immune pathways. Unlike CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a uses only a single catalytic site to both cleave target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (cis-activity) and indiscriminately degrade single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (trans-activity). To investigate how the relative potency of cis- versus trans-DNase activity affects Cas12a-mediated genome editing, we first used structure-guided engineering to generate variants of Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas12a (LbCas12a) that selectively disrupt trans-activity. The resulting engineered mutant with the biggest differential between cis- and trans-DNase activity in vitro showed minimal genome editing activity in human cells, motivating a second set of experiments using directed evolution to generate additional mutants with robust genome editing activity. Notably, these engineered and evolved mutants had enhanced ability to induce homology-directed repair (HDR) editing by 2-18-fold depending on the genomic locus. Finally, we found that a site-specific reversion mutation produced improved Cas12a (iCas12a) variants with superior genome editing efficiency at genomic sites that are difficult to edit using wild-type Cas12a. This strategy of coupled rational engineering and directed evolution establishes a pipeline for creating improved genome editing tools by combining structural insights with randomization and selection. The availability of experimental and predicted structures of other CRISPR-Cas enzymes will enable this strategy to be applied to improve the efficacy of other genome editing proteins."

Here, we show that the CRISPR-Csm complex, a multi-protein effector from type III CRISPR immune systems in prokaryotes, provides surgical RNA ablation of both nuclear and cytoplasmic transcripts. As part of the most widely occurring CRISPR adaptive immunity pathway, CRISPR-Csm uses a programmable RNA-guided mechanism to find and degrade target RNA molecules without inducing indiscriminate trans-cleavage of cellular RNAs, giving it an important advantage over the CRISPR-Cas13-family enzymes. Using single-vector delivery of the S. thermophilus Csm complex, we observe high-efficiency RNA knockdown (90-99%) and minimal off-target effects in human cells, outperforming existing technologies including shRNA- and Cas13-mediated knockdown. We also find that catalytically inactivated Csm achieves specific and durable RNA binding, a property we harness for live-cell RNA imaging. These results establish the feasibility and efficacy of multi-protein CRISPR-Cas effector complexes as RNA-targeting tools in eukaryotes."

DNA origami structures, where 1000's of bases are folded into a compact nanostructure, present an attractive approach to package genes; however, effective delivery of genetic material into cell nuclei has remained a critical challenge. Here we describe the use of DNA nanostructures encoding an intact human gene and a fluorescent-protein encoding gene as compact templates for gene integration by CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). Our design includes CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) binding sites on the DNA nanostructures to increase shuttling of structures into the nucleus. We demonstrate efficient shuttling and genomic integration of DNA nanostructures using transfection and electroporation. These nanostructured templates display lower toxicity and higher insertion efficiency compared to unstructured double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates in human primary cells. Furthermore, our study validates virus-like particles (VLPs) as an efficient method of DNA nanostructure delivery, opening the possibility of delivering DNA nanostructures in vivo to specific cell types. Together these results provide new approaches to gene delivery with DNA nanostructures and establish their use as large HDR templates, exploiting both their design features and their ability to encode genetic information. This work also opens a door to translate other DNA nanodevice functions, such as measuring biophysical properties, into cell nuclei."

Target capture requires Cas9 to unwind DNA at candidate 4 sequences using an unknown ATP-independent mechanism2, 3. Here we show that 5 Cas9 sharply bends and undertwists DNA at each PAM, thereby flipping DNA 6 nucleotides out of the duplex and toward the guide RNA for sequence 7 interrogation. Cryo-electron-microscopy (EM) structures of Cas9: RNA: DNA 8 complexes trapped at different states of the interrogation pathway, together with 9 solution conformational probing, reveal that global protein rearrangement 10 accompanies formation of an unstacked DNA hinge. Bend-induced base flipping 11 explains how Cas9 \u201creads\u201d snippets of DNA to locate target sites within a vast 12 excess of non-target DNA, a process crucial to both bacterial antiviral immunity 13 and genome editing. This mechanism establishes a physical solution to the 14 problem of complementarity-guided DNA search and shows how interrogation 15 speed and local DNA geometry may influence genome editing efficiency. 16"

UU. En este sentido representa un perfil acad\u00e9mico muy distinto al de su colaboradora Emmanuelle Charpentier, a quien conoci\u00f3 en 2011 en un congreso internacional y con quien propuso en 2012 en un art\u00edculo seminal en la revista Science (1), que los sistemas de defensa CRISPR-Cas que las bacterias y las arqueas usan para defenderse de bacteri\u00f3fagos, descubiertos por Francis Mojica (Universidad de Alicante) en 2005, pueden convertirse en verdaderas herramientas de edici\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica. Esta propuesta, ampliamente refrendada por muchos investigadores de todo el mundo, la llev\u00f3 a recibir un merecido Premio Nobel de Qu\u00edmica en 2020, distinci\u00f3n que comparti\u00f3 con Charpentier.A la corta de edad de 7 a\u00f1os Doudna se mud\u00f3 con su familia a Hilo (Hawaii, EE.

La atm\u00f3sfera acad\u00e9mica familiar, ambos progenitores eran profesores universitarios, el contacto con una flora y fauna exuberantes, y una profesora de Qu\u00edmica en el instituto despertaron sin duda la curiosidad de esa ni\u00f1a que decidi\u00f3 convertirse en cient\u00edfica (2)."

For the first time in history, the prize has been awarded within nine years of the discovery and the awardees are an all-female team after Marie Curie (1911) and Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1967), who are single awardees of the Nobel Prize. No doubt, this discovery has opened up new horizons for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. The story of CRISPR/Cas reiterates how research in basic science opens up doors for innovations! A study on arms race between the tiny bacteria and their tiniest enemy, the viruses (Yes! the bacteria are attacked by viruses, commonly called bacteriophages), has endowed a lot to the world of science. The bacteria have many elegant mechanisms to counteract the invading viruses2. The CRISPR-Cas system that stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and the CRISPR associated genes is one such mechanism3, 4. This system stores the memories of the viral attacks as spacers, equally sized signature sequences of the viral genomes, within this CRISPR3, 4. These spacers are regularly interspaced within the palindromic repeats3, 4. The cas genes, encoding the protein machinery to carry out this task is always found next to the CRISPR loci. This system is being studied in various bacteria found in different habitats including thermal springs, human body, soil, etc. Since the discovery \u2026"

In many cases, it is essential to perform two versions of the same experiment: one with the 5\u2032 DNA end labeled and one with the 3\u2032 DNA end labeled. While homogeneous 5\u2032-radiolabeling can be accomplished using a single kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation step, existing procedures for 3\u2032-radiolabeling often result in probe heterogeneity, prohibiting precise DNA fragment identification in downstream experiments. We present here a new protocol to efficiently attach a 32 P-phosphate to the 3\u2032 end of a DNA oligonucleotide of arbitrary sequence, relying on inexpensive DNA oligonucleotide modifications (2\u2032-O-methylribonucleotide and ribonucleotide sugar substitutions), two enzymes (T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 RNA ligase 2), and the \u2026"

In some embodiments, the systems, methods, and devices may include a filter or membrane that may help to separate the tethered and untethered reporter molecules. These devices, systems, and techniques allow a user to rapidly process samples that may contain the target RNA, without needing to amplify the target sequences. These devices and methods may be used to assay a wide variety of samples and target RNA sources, for the presence or absence of a specific target RNA sequence.

I do have to tell you something important about Cold Spring Harbor. I was having dinner last night with a couple of colleagues and we were chitchatting about different experiences we\u2019d had here at the lab. We realized that each of us at different times had given our very first scientific lecture here at Cold Spring Harbor, and for each of us it had been a transformative experience. So, I just want to point out that the lab plays a critical role not only in all of the incredible science that you\u2019ve heard, but also for the next generation and helping people from all around the world come together and think and do science in a way that is really quite unique.In that spirit, I want to tell you about an area of science that \u2026"

CRISPR-based approaches can modify host genes involved in viral infection or target viral RNA directly using newly discovered functions in SpyCas9 homologs. As a host-directed therapeutic, we have focused on NPC1, the entry receptor for Ebola virus. By utilizing Cas9 directed knockouts of NPC1, we blocked Ebola infection in cell culture. As a direct defense against RNA viruses, we performed a tiling library screen using RNA-targeting Cas9 against RVFV and identified several guide RNAs that protect cells from infection. Additionally, we demonstrated the adaptation of lipid-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle technology for cellular delivery of Cas9/gRNA RNP in an attempt to overcome a major hurdle in the clinical translation of CRISPR-based countermeasures."

Here we report the design and in vitro evaluation of S. pyogenes Cas9 proteins harboring asialoglycoprotein receptor ligands (ASGPrL). In particular, we demonstrate that the resulting ribonucleoproteins (Cas9\u2010ASGPrL RNP) can be engineered to be preferentially internalized into cells expressing the corresponding receptor on their surface. Live cell imaging studies are consistent with a receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis mechanism of active uptake of the RNP. When uptake occurred in the presence of a peptide with endosomolytic properties, we observed receptor\u2010facilitated and cell\u2010type specific gene editing that did not rely on \u2026"

                "abstract": "Genome editing, or genome editing with engineered nucleases (GEEN) is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted or replaced in the genome of an organism using engineered nucleases, or \u201cmolecular scissors.\u201d These nucleases create site-specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired locations in the genome. The induced double-strand breaks are repaired through nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), resulting in targeted mutations (\u2018edits\u2019). There are currently four families of engineered nucleases being used: meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector-based nucleases (TALEN), and the CRISPR-Cas system. Genome editing was selected by Nature Methods as the 2011 Method of the Year. The CRISPR-Cas system was selected by Science as 2015 Breakthrough of the Year.         In the present book, fifteen typical literatures about genome editing published on international authoritative journals were selected to introduce the worldwide newest progress, which contains reviews or original researches on genetic engineering, biotechnology, medical science, etc. We hope this book can demonstrate advances in genome editing as well as give references to the researchers, students and other related people."

Here we demonstrate that the compound PF-06446846 inhibits translation of PCSK9 by inducing the ribosome to stall around codon 34, mediated by the sequence of the nascent chain within the exit tunnel. We further show that PF-06446846 reduces plasma PCSK9 and total cholesterol levels in rats following oral dosing. Using ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that PF-06446846 is highly selective for the inhibition of PCSK9 translation. The mechanism of action employed by PF-06446846 reveals a previously unexpected tunability of the human ribosome, which allows small molecules to specifically block translation of individual transcripts.A small-molecule PCSK9 inhibitor targets the human ribosome and selectively prevents PCSK9 synthesis."

At the same time, I'd avoided thinking too much about the philosophical and ethical ramifications of widely accessible tools for altering genomes."

Cas9-guide RNA complexes recognize and cleave double-stranded DNA sequences on the basis of 20-nucleotide RNA-DNA complementarity, but the mechanism of target searching in mammalian cells is unknown. Here, we use single-particle tracking to visualize diffusion and chromatin binding of Cas9 in living cells. We show that three-dimensional diffusion dominates Cas9 searching in vivo, and off-target binding events are, on average, short-lived (< 1 second). Searching is dependent on the local chromatin environment, with less sampling and slower movement within heterochromatin. These results reveal how the bacterial Cas9 protein interrogates mammalian genomes and navigates eukaryotic chromatin structure."

Brr2 is a member of the DExD/H family of RNA-dependent ATPases that unwinds the extensively base paired U4/U6 snRNAs during pre-mRNA splicing. This reaction is stimulated by the C-terminus of another spliceosomal protein, Prp8. Prp8 has been shown to bind between Brr2\u2019s tandem repeat of helicase domains, only the first of which has catalytic activity (1). The lengthy base pairing interaction between U4 and U6 suggests Brr2 must act processively to unwind them. However, there is currently little mechanistic detail describing how Brr2 unwinds the U4/U6 snRNAs. We are performing a biochemical characterization of the Brr2 helicase activity using a minimal in vitro system.

TRBP enhances Dicer's processing of both microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) precursors, yet the mechanistic basis of this effect has not been elucidated. Here we report a robust sliding activity of TRBP exclusively on double stranded RNA (dsRNA). TRBP exhibits ATP-independent motion selectively on double stranded RNA in a length dependent manner. We find that the first two double stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) of TRBP, which stimulate the dicing activity, are also directly responsible for the sliding motion, whereas the third dsRBD is dispensable. The same sliding motion was also observed in two other dsRBD-possessing proteins, PACT, and R3D1, implying a universality of sliding activity in this family of proteins.

We are investigating how initiation occurs on eukaryotic ribosomes, either through the actions of initiation factor proteins or via internal ribosome entry site RNAs (IRESs) that direct ribosomes to the translational start codon without requiring most initiation factors. Cellular IRESs are thought to play crucial roles in adaptation to environmental stresses that inhibit most protein synthesis. Recent results in yeast and human systems will be discussed."

India also created a fund to encourage collaboration by industry with government and academia. In China, the minister of science and technology announced that total R&D investment in China grew by 22% in 2006, totaling 300 billion yuan (US $37.5 billion). This accounted for 1.4% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). Historically, the US investment in R&D has been a larger percentage of GDP than that of other countries, except Japan. The dwindling investment in young researchers by the US government is conspicuous. Principal investigators on National Institutes of Health (NIH) projects are forced to make difficult choices based not on talent but on financial stability by funding fewer researchers in their laboratories. Although the NIH budget was doubled between 1998 and 2003, it has since been stagnant. The result is an 8% decrease in purchasing power. Moreover, 8 out of 10 grant applications are unfunded. The effects on young scientists are devastating: the average age for a first-time R01 investigator grant recipient is approaching 40 years, and young scientists are discouraged from pursuing academic research careers because of this unfavorable climate. The short-term decisions on federal spending that direct the amount and emphasis of research funding in the US are stifling the current generation of aspiring scientists. Despite these concerns, President George W. Bush would only modestly increase the 2008 budget of the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy \u2026"

In some eukaryotic viruses, RNA upstream of the coding region forms an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that directly binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and enables translation initiation in the absence of many canonical translation initiation factors. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES RNA requires just two initiation factors, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 and eIF3, to form preinitiation 48S ribosomal complexes that subsequently assemble into translation-competent ribosomes. Using an RNA-based affinity purification approach, we show here that HCV IRES RNA facilitates eIF2 function through its interactions with eIF3 and the 40S ribosomal subunit. Although the wild-type IRES assembles normally into 48S and 80S ribosomal complexes in human cell extract, mutant IRES RNAs become \u2026"

The molecular mechanisms by which eIF3 exerts these functions are poorly understood. To learn more about the structure and function of eIF3 we have expressed and purified individual human eIF3 subunits or complexes of eIF3 subunits using baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The results indicate that the subunits of human eIF3 that have homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae form subcomplexes that reflect the subunit interactions seen in the yeast eIF3 core complex. In addition, we have used an in vitro 40 S ribosomal subunit binding assay to investigate subunit requirements for efficient association of the eIF3 subcomplexes to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. eIF3j alone binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and its \u2026"

                "abstract": "The recent identification of several catalytically active RNA molecules'-6 has led to extensive speculation concerning the role of RNA in the origin of life? A self-replicating RNA or related polynucleotide is thought to be the key intermediate in the evolution of living systems from prebiotic chemicals. The identification or design of an RNA replicase would therefore be helpful in establishing the feasibility of this pathway, and might also allow the construction of simple proto-cells in the laboratory. The protozoan Tetrahymena self-splicing intron. 2, 6 is of particular interest in this respect because of the variety of phosphoester transfer reactions that it can catalyse. The activities of this ribozyme, demonstrated in a series of experiments by Cech and coworkers, include that of a ribonuclease, phos-photransferase, acid phosphatase and RNA restriction endonuclease An enzyme capable of catalysing transesterification reactions on RNA substrates is potentially capable of catalysing RNA polymerization. Indeed, Zaug and Cech'? and Been and Cech's have shown that the intron will catalyse limited polymerization of ribonucleotides onto a short primer annealed to a sequence within the intron. But the primer could be extended only to a maximum of~ 15 nucleotides, and the nucleotides were added beyond the end of the template\"\". These experiments, although demonstrating the ability of the Tetrahymena ribozyme to poly-merize RNA, also pointed out the problems to be overcome before replicase activity could be approached: first, the template must be on a separate molecule from the replicase; second, the polymerase activity must be template directed; and \u2026"

These ribozymes were separated into three short RNA fragments that formed active catalytic complexes. One of the multisubunit sunYderivatives catalyzed the synthesis of a strand of RNA complementary to one of its own subunits. These results suggest that prebiotically synthesized oligonucleotides might have been able to assemble into a complex capable of self-replication.NA MOLECULES CAPABLE OF SELF replication are postulated to have been important in the early evolu-tion of life (1\u20144). However, an RNA repli-case probably requires a folded structure to carry out ef\ufb01cient catalysis, while an optimal template is unstructured.

Autologous T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) manufactured by viral transduction are approved to treat multiple blood cancers, but additional genetic modifications to alter cell programs will likely be required to treat solid tumors and for allogeneic cellular therapies. We have developed a one-step strategy using engineered lentiviral particles to introduce Cas9 RNPs and a CAR transgene into primary human T cells without electroporation. Furthermore, programming particle tropism allows us to target a specific cell type within a mixed cell population. As a proof-of-concept, we show that HIV-1 envelope targeted particles to edit CD4+ cells while sparing co-cultured CD8+ cells. This adaptable approach to immune cell engineering ex vivo provides a strategy applicable to the genetic modification of targeted somatic cells in vivo."

Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems, the most widespread and diverse of these adaptive immune systems, use an RNA-guided multi-protein complex to find foreign nucleic acids and trigger their destruction. In this review, we describe how these multisubunit complexes target and cleave DNA and RNA, and how regulatory molecules control their activities. We also highlight similarities and differences to Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems, which use a single-protein effector, as well as other types of bacterial and eukaryotic immune systems. We summarize current applications of the Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems for DNA/RNA modification, control of gene expression, and nucleic acid detection."

However, these particularly distressing diseases remain a grave problem and globally some 400,000 are diagnosed each year in young people up to the age of nineteen\u2014that\u2019s one every three minutes. In addition, it\u2019s estimated that across the world about one third of child cancers are not diagnosed at all. In the USA about 16,000 children under 19 years of age are diagnosed with cancer each year and, despite treatment advances, some 20% do not survive. In the UK the figures are nearly 2000 new cases and about 240 deaths."

In Chapter 1, challenges to the Bateman principle are argued to undermine the logic that parental investment is a key constraint on reproductive strategies\u2014ie, males benefit from multiple matings, females not so much, because sperm are cheap relative to eggs. Alas, the interesting evolutionary questions of why female fruit flies lay slightly more eggs when opportunities for multiple matings are available, and why human females might benefit from polyandry are not pursued. Chapter 2 focuses on a hypothetical example from evolutionary psychology:\u201cone hundred babies.\u201d Fine evaluates the proposition that one man can produce as many as 100 offspring by indiscriminately mating with 100 women in a given year. Her analysis concludes that this is about as likely as being hit by a meteor. But let us be careful not to throw the babies out with the bathwater. Although cases of extraordinary male fertility, say 50 babies in a year, are rare and limited to emperors and the like, reproductive skew in subsistence societies may be as high as two, resulting in potentially significant selective pressures. Still, there may not have been a uniform pattern throughout human evolutionary history. Chapter 3 mends the contretemps with a reasoned evolutionary roadmap for the complexities and nuances and diversity of human sexuality. Part Two examines the genetic, neurological, and hormonal mechanisms that influence human development. Chapter 4 explains how the apparent dichotomy of XX versus XY is fuzzy. The \u2026"

However, in nature RNA is rnost often a single-stranded molecule. Not locked into a duplex, it is free to assume any of a variety of structures.

High-fidelity (SpCas9-HF1) and enhanced 24 specificity (eSpCas9 (1.1)) variants exhibit substantially reduced off-target cleavage in 25 human cells, but the mechanism of target discrimination and the potential to further 26 improve fidelity were unknown5-9. Using single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer 27 (smFRET) experiments, we show that both SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9 (1.1) are trapped in 28 an inactive state10 when bound to mismatched targets. We find that a non-catalytic domain 29 within Cas9, REC3, recognizes target mismatches and governs the HNH nuclease to 30 regulate overall catalytic competence. Exploiting this observation, we identified residues 31 within REC3 involved in mismatch sensing and designed a new hyper-accurate Cas9 32 variant (HypaCas9) that retains robust on-target activity in human cells. These results 33 offer a more comprehensive model to rationalize and modify the balance between target 34 recognition and nuclease activation for precision genome editing. 3536 Efforts to minimize off-target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9 have motivated the development of 37 SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9 (1.1) variants that contain amino acid substitutions predicted to 38 weaken the energetics of target site recognition and cleavage8, 9 (Figure 1a).

However, in nature RNA is most often a single-stranded molecule. Not locked into a duplex-, it is free to assume any of a variety of structures.

The Sin3 corepressor functions as a molecular adaptor linking histone deacetylases on the one hand, with the chromatin targeting subunits Pf1 and MRG15 on the other. Pf1 also functions as an adaptor by interacting with MRG15 and engaging in multivalent interactions with Sin3 targeting among other domains the two N-terminal paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domains that serve as sites of interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors.

We reviewed 42 oncologic patients with ONJ between 2007 and 2010. Only patients with solids tumors and who had received ZA were included. Data analyses included age, sex, underlying disease, ZA and BVZ dosages, dental history and ONJ characteristics. Of the 42 ONJ patients treated with ZA, 10 also received BVZ. In the 10 ZA/BVZ patients, the mean duration of ZA treatment at the time of ONJ diagnosis was 12.4 months (\u00b1 6.8), compared to 22.9 months (\u00b1 4.8) in the 32 patients who received ZA only (p < 0.05). Cox's model analysis of the delay to ONJ diagnosis confirmed the impact of BVZ on ONJ diagnosis. In the ZA/BVZ-treated group, 7 (70%) patients developed spontaneous osteonecrosis.

The first device is Abbott's BVS\u00ae, a poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA)-based everolimus-eluting device, which has been tested in a registry and two non-randomized trials. Clinical results seem close to what is expected from a modern DES, but possibly with more post-procedural side-effects. Two randomized trials versus DES are underway. This device is already marketed in many European countries. The second device is Elixir's DESolve\u00ae, a PLLA-based novolimus-eluting device, which has been evaluated in two single-arm trials \u2026"

Samples of Mynol and Maillefer filling points were thermally treated and then submitted to thermomechanical analysis in parallel with differential scanning calorimetric analysis.The results show that thermomechanical analysis gives results distinct from those obtained by classic dilatometry and that it is a technique well suited to the study of the thermoplastic properties of guttapercha. An analysis of the results shows that the amount of the inorganic component used in a commercially available endodontic point has a strong influence on its thermomechanical properties. Thermodynamical properties and the \u201cthermal history\u201d of the gutta-percha are also important. Both \u2026"

A Bayesian hierarchical model of measurement error, allowing the meta-analytic estimation of both central and dispersion parameters (under the assumption of normality of measurement errors) is proposed and applied to published data; the resulting potential decision errors are deduced from this estimation. The same method is used to assess the impact of an initial calibration. The posterior distributions are summarized as mean \u00b1 sd (credible interval). The fitted model exhibits a modest mean expected error (0.24 \u00b1 0.73 (\u22121.23 1.59) g/dL) and a large variability (mean absolute expected error 1.18 \u00b1 0.92 (0.05 3.36) g/dL). The initial calibration modifies the bias (\u22120.20 \u00b1 0.87 (\u22121.99 1.49) g/dL), but the variability remains almost as large (mean absolute expected error 1.05 \u00b1 0.87 (0.04 3.21) g/dL). This entails a potential decision error (\u201cfalse positive\u201d or \u201cfalse negative\u201d) for about one patient out of seven. The proposed hierarchical model allows the estimation of the variability from published aggregates, and allows the modeling of the consequences of this variability in terms of decision errors. For the device under assessment, these potential decision errors are clinically problematic."

To assess in vivo reproducibility, we determined the coefficient of variation (cv) on the basis of five measurements (with repositioning) of the same foot in 50 women. The cv was 2.8+/-1.7%. BUA values were similar in the right feet and left foot and were correlated with bone density in the calcaneal area investigated (r= 0.8, p< 10 (-4). BUA of the calcaneus was correlated with bone density in the lumbar spine, femur, and forearm in 240 healthy postmenopausal women (correlation coefficients 0.36 to 0.55; p< 10 (-4)). BUA decreased with age, with a sharper drop during the first years following menopause. Mean broadband ultrasonic attenuation in 37 females with osteoporosis (58.92+/-11.59 dB/MHz) is lower than controls (66.10+/-15.29 dB/MHz, p= 0.04). Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves, used to evaluate the discriminating value of BUA in osteoporosis and osteopenia, were 0.79 and 0.72, respectively. The kappa coefficient of concordance between BUA and spinal density was 0.59. These data demonstrate that BUA cannot replace bone density measurements. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the potential role of this technique for identifying women at high risk for osteoporotic fractures."

Public hospitals have a certain autonomy in choosing the drugs and medical devices they use, with supervision in some cases by the regional health authority (e.g. expensive drugs or medical devices, authorisation for some equipment). To help hospital decision-makers in choosing health technologies to finance and use, different structures were put in place, such as committees, commissions, and/or innovation units. The CEDIT is one of the most formalised and structured French hospital organisations aiming to undertake HTA as a tool for decision-makers."

The aim of this study was to assess the overall benefit of ultrafiltration therapy in patients with acute or persistent congestive heart failure. We conducted a health technology assessment following the EUnetHTA guidelines, with systematic literature review from bibliographic medical databases, independent experts and manufacturer interviews. Thirteen clinical trials and five meta-analyses were examined. In the most recent one, 608 patients were included, of which 304 received ultrafiltration therapy and 304 received intravenous loop diuretics. Ultrafiltration therapy seems to be more beneficial regarding the fluid removal and the body weight reduction,(mean difference respectively 1.44 kg, IC95%[0.29; 2.59], P-value= 0.01 and 1.28 L [0.43; 2.12], P-value= 0.003). No difference has been showed in overall mortality, renal function, hospital readmission or safety. Medico-economic studies are incomplete and contradictory. Ultrafiltration therapy seems to be effective, most likely for patients ineligible or resistant to intravenous diuretics. But most topics remain uncertain, mainly impact on overall mortality, safety and cost-effectiveness. Given these knowledge-gaps, the generalization of ultrafiltration therapy should be examined cautiously, and conditional upon a large-scale systematic evaluation."

The expert committee has a threefold mission: i) perform an annual up-date of IVIg classification using three categories: accepted indications (group I), currently deabated indications (group II), and unwarranted indications (group III); ii) develop guidelines for improved therapeutic strategies; iii) stimulate research. Data on use of IVIg are collected in 16 pilot hospitals. These data designate IVIg prescriptions by indication. Data are centralized by the CEDIT which publishes an annual report. Between 1988 and 1991, prescription of IVIg increased at an average annual rate of 33%. Between 1991 and 1996, the amount of IVIg used leveled off: approximately 330 kilograms/year, excluding research protocols. In 1997 there was a decline to 299 kilograms accounting for a total expenditure of 44 million French francs (US $6.7 M). In 1997, group I prescriptions represented 80% of all IVIg prescriptions, group II 9.8% and group III 9.1%. Comparison of medical practice with a scientificaly recognised reference made it possible for AP-HP to set up an effective regulation of IVIg prescriptions. The longevity of this evaluation work is by itself a success."

Sa forme pr\u00e9coce \u00e9volutive (Early Onset Scoliosis ou EOS) n\u00e9cessite parfois le recours \u00e0 un traitement chirurgical y compris par des tiges de croissance dont une nouvelle modalit\u00e9 est constitu\u00e9e par les tiges magn\u00e9tiques.Aspects techniques: il s\u2019 agit de dispositifs orthop\u00e9diques extensibles fix\u00e9s sur le rachis dont l\u2019allongement se fait \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une commande depuis l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, sans intervention chirurgicale. Deux mod\u00e8les existent: PHENIX et MAGEC. Peu d\u2019informations sont disponibles pour les tiges PHENIX.

To assess in vivo reproducibility, we determined the coefficient of variation (cv) on the basis of five measurements (with repositioning) of the same foot in 50 women. The cv was 2.8 +/- 1.7%. BUA values were similar in the right feet and left foot and were correlated with bone density in the calcaneal area investigated (r = 0.8, p < 10-4). BUA of the calcaneus was correlated with bone density in the lumbar spine, femur, and forearm in 240 healthy postmenopausal women (correlation coefficients 0.36 to 0.55; p < 10(-4)). BUA decreased with age, with a sharper drop during the first years following menopause. Mean broadband ultrasonic attenuation in 37 females with osteoporosis (58.92 +/- 11.59 dB/MHz) is lower than controls (66.10 +/- 15.29 dB/MHz, p = 0.04). Areas under receiver \u2026"

To assess its clinical potential, a systematic review of the literature indexed in the standard biomedical bibliographic databases selected eight prospective randomized clinical trials; seven of them, comparing coronary brachytherapy and non-treatment or placebo, have been included in the present meta-analysis. This analysis confirms the angiographic benefit of this procedure, as reported in the individual studies; it also shows, however an excess of clinical adverse effects not exhibited by any individual trial. Therefore, intracoronary brachytherapy cannot be recommended as routine practice, while one cannot rule out its interest in special situations."

Seventy one children (36 males and 35 females) aged between 9 days and 18 years (average: 43 months) were included in the study. Technical performances of all radiological equipment used were permanently checked through a quality control program. One conventional and 3\" photostimulable\" films were performed for each patient included (mAs product selected for\" photostimulable\" system was progressively reduced down to 60% of that of conventional technique). TLD Lithium Fluoride chips were used to measure entrance surface dose during the examination. Image quality of 284 films (213\" photostimulable\"+ 71 conventional) was assessed by three independent radiologists. Advantages and drawbacks of both studied imaging techniques are discussed in terms of patient dose reduction and image quality."

These data have been compared to the corresponding findings established during 1972 in the same department. Traumatology appears to be a more and more limited activity among neurosurgical emergencies: 55% of admissions in 1972, 43% in 1983-84. The main characteristics of injured patients on admission have not changed: 65% are in a coma, 1.25 are operated in emergency, age distribution and types of lesion are identical. The sorting of the patients has improved: 25% of them were operated upon in 1972, 37% in 1983-84. Conveyance of injured patients has undoubtedly improved in quality during the last years; yet the duration of transport is still important, too important, even in Paris: 2 h 30 as an average-time. Another favorable factor has been the coming out of CT-Scan; it is of course of great help for diagnosis, but it must not let forget basic and fundamental therapeutic decisions."

The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology."

The RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from the microbial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system can be used to facilitate efficient genome engineering in eukaryotic cells by simply specifying a 20-nt targeting sequence within its guide RNA. Here we describe a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. Beginning \u2026"

Using this system, DNA sequences within the endogenous genome and their functional outputs are now easily edited or modulated in virtually any organism of choice. Cas9-mediated genetic perturbation is simple and scalable, empowering researchers to elucidate the functional organization of the genome at the systems level and establish causal linkages between genetic variations and biological phenotypes.

We adapted for this purpose the naturally occurring algal protein Channelrhodopsin-2, a rapidly gated light-sensitive cation channel, by using lentiviral gene delivery in combination with high-speed optical switching to photostimulate mammalian neurons. We demonstrate reliable, millisecond-timescale control of neuronal spiking, as well as control of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. This technology allows the use of light to alter neural processing at the level of single spikes and synaptic events, yielding a widely applicable tool for neuroscientists and biomedical engineers."

We show that lentiviral delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enables both negative and positive selection screening in human cells. First, we used the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic RAF inhibitor. Our highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12, as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1.

The CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted as an efficient gene-targeting technology with the potential for multiplexed genome editing. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing allows the simultaneous disruption of five genes (Tet1, 2, 3, Sry, Uty - 8 alleles) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with high efficiency. Coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting Tet1 and Tet2 into zygotes generated mice with biallelic mutations in both genes with an efficiency of 80%. Finally, we show that coinjection of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNAs with mutant oligos generated precise point mutations simultaneously in two target genes. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas system allows the one-step generation of animals \u2026"

Previously, we used a genome-scale CRISPR knockout (GeCKO) library to identify loss-of-function mutations conferring vemurafenib resistance in a melanoma model1. However, initial lentiviral delivery systems for CRISPR screening had low viral titer or required a cell line already expressing Cas9, thereby limiting the range of biological systems amenable to screening. We sought to improve both the lentiviral packaging and choice of guide sequences in our original GeCKO library1, where a pooled library of synthesized oligonucleotides was cloned into a lentiviral backbone containing both the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nuclease and \u2026"

The Cas9 nuclease from the microbial CRISPR-Cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the DNA target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. Here, we describe an approach that combines a Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage \u2026"

Here, we report characterization of Cpf1, a putative class 2 CRISPR effector. We demonstrate that Cpf1 mediates robust DNA interference with features distinct from Cas9. Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease lacking tracrRNA, and it utilizes a T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif. Moreover, Cpf1 cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA double-stranded break. Out of 16 Cpf1-family proteins, we identified two candidate enzymes from Acidaminococcus and Lachnospiraceae, with efficient genome-editing activity in human cells.

We reprogram dual-RNA: Cas9 specificity by changing the sequence of short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to make single-and multinucleotide changes carried on editing templates. Simultaneous use of two crRNAs enables multiplex mutagenesis.

What induces this activity band has been the subject of speculation and theory. Two papers in this issue report the use of cell-type-targeted optogenetic technologies to test the currently favoured theory \u2014 that these oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, also known as parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. The results suggest that the theory is correct. Cardin et al. show that a gamma state can be driven by specific activation of FS interneurons in vivo, and that sensory input relative to these oscillations can determine the extent of evoked cortical activity. Sohal et al. report empirical evidence for the involvement of specific activation of FS interneurons \u2026"

Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200\u2009Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude \u2026"

However, the size of the commonly used Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) limits its utility for basic research and therapeutic applications that use the highly versatile adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery vehicle. Here, we characterize six smaller Cas9 orthologues and show that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) can edit the genome with efficiencies similar to those of SpCas9, while being more than 1 kilobase shorter. We packaged SaCas9 and its single guide RNA expression cassette into a single AAV vector and targeted the cholesterol regulatory gene Pcsk9 in the mouse liver. Within one week of injection, we observed >40% gene modification, accompanied by significant reductions in serum Pcsk9 and total cholesterol levels. We further assess the genome-wide targeting specificity of SaCas9 \u2026"

Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at targeted genomic loci complementary to a short RNA guide. However, Cas9 can cleave off-target sites that are not fully complementary to the guide, which poses a major challenge for genome editing. Here, we use structure-guided protein engineering to improve the specificity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). Using targeted deep sequencing and unbiased whole-genome off-target analysis to assess Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage in human cells, we demonstrate that \u201cenhanced specificity\u201d SpCas9 (eSpCas9) variants reduce off-target effects and maintain robust on-target cleavage. Thus, eSpCas9 could be broadly useful for genome-editing applications requiring a high level of specificity."

NpHR allows either knockout of single action potentials, or sustained blockade of spiking. NpHR is compatible with ChR2, the previous optical excitation technology we have described, in that the two opposing probes operate at similar light powers but with well-separated action spectra. NpHR, like ChR2, functions in mammals without exogenous cofactors, and the two probes can be integrated with calcium imaging in mammalian brain tissue for bidirectional optical modulation and readout of neural activity.

The structure revealed a bilobed architecture composed of target recognition and nuclease lobes, accommodating the sgRNA:DNA heteroduplex in a positively charged groove at their interface. Whereas the recognition lobe is essential for binding sgRNA and DNA, the nuclease lobe contains the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains, which are properly positioned for cleavage of the complementary and noncomplementary strands of the target DNA, respectively. The nuclease lobe also contains a carboxyl-terminal domain responsible for the interaction with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).

To broadly enable the application of Cas9 in vivo, we established a Cre-dependent Cas9 knockin mouse. We demonstrated in vivo as well as ex vivo genome editing using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-, lentivirus-, or particle-mediated delivery of guide RNA in neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells. Using these mice, we simultaneously modeled the dynamics of KRAS, p53, and LKB1, the top three significantly mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma. Delivery of a single AAV vector in the lung generated loss-of-function mutations in p53 and Lkb1, as well as homology-directed repair-mediated KrasG12D mutations, leading to macroscopic tumors of adenocarcinoma pathology. Together, these results suggest that Cas9 mice empower a wide range of biological and disease modeling applications."

In vitro biochemical analysis shows that C2c2 is guided by a single CRISPR RNA and can be programmed to cleave single-stranded RNA targets carrying complementary protospacers. In bacteria, C2c2 can be programmed to knock down specific mRNAs. Cleavage is mediated by catalytic residues in the two conserved Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domains, mutations of which generate catalytically inactive RNA-binding proteins.

That work, in tissue slices and in C. elegans roundworms, showed that brain cells can be genetically engineered to alter their activity in response to pulses of different colours of light. A follow-up study now shows that behaviour can be modified in a living mammal by similar means. Hypocretin (Hcrt)-producing neurons in the hypothalamus are active during transitions from sleep to waking states. Optical stimulation of mouse Hcrt neurons engineered to respond to light increases the likelihood of transition from sleep to wakefulness, with higher frequencies causing more abrupt awakening. As Hcrt deficiency is linked to narcolepsy, these results may provide insights into sleep disorders."

However, without technology to control specific neurons with appropriate temporal precision in freely behaving mammals, the causal role of these action potential patterns in driving behavioral changes has been unclear. We used optogenetic tools to selectively stimulate VTA dopaminergic neuron action potential firing in freely behaving mammals. We found that phasic activation of these neurons was sufficient to drive behavioral conditioning and elicited dopamine transients with magnitudes not achieved by longer, lower-frequency spiking. These results demonstrate that phasic dopaminergic activity is sufficient to mediate mammalian behavioral conditioning."

We recently developed a platform termed SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) that combines isothermal preamplification with Cas13 to detect single molecules of RNA or DNA. Through characterization of CRISPR enzymology and application development, we report here four advances integrated into SHERLOCK version 2 (SHERLOCKv2) (i) four-channel single-reaction multiplexing with orthogonal CRISPR enzymes; (ii) quantitative measurement of input as low as 2 attomolar; (iii) 3.5-fold increase in signal sensitivity by combining Cas13 with Csm6, an auxiliary CRISPR-associated enzyme; and (iv) lateral-flow readout. SHERLOCKv2 can detect Dengue or Zika virus single-stranded RNA as well as mutations in patient liquid biopsy samples via lateral flow, highlighting its potential as \u2026"

Using public datasets, MAGeCK identified novel essential genes and pathways, including EGFR in vemurafenib-treated A375 cells harboring a BRAF mutation. MAGeCK also detected cell type-specific essential genes, including BCR and ABL1, in KBM7 cells bearing a BCR-ABL fusion, and IGF1R in HL-60 cells, which depends on the insulin signaling pathway for proliferation."

Genome editing is already broadening our ability to elucidate the contribution of genetics to disease by facilitating the creation of more accurate cellular and animal models of pathological processes. A particularly tantalizing application of programmable nucleases is the potential to directly correct genetic mutations in affected tissues and cells to treat diseases that are refractory to traditional therapies. Here we discuss current progress toward developing programmable nuclease\u2013based therapies as well as future prospects and challenges."

Genome editing has the potential to restore expression of a modified dystrophin gene from the native locus to modulate disease progression. In this study, adeno-associated virus was used to deliver the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\u2013Cas9 system to the mdx mouse model of DMD to remove the mutated exon 23 from the dystrophin gene. This includes local and systemic delivery to adult mice and systemic delivery to neonatal mice. Exon 23 deletion by CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in expression of the modified dystrophin gene, partial recovery of functional dystrophin protein in skeletal myofibers and cardiac muscle, improvement of muscle biochemistry, and significant enhancement of muscle force.

Cas9 is an RNA-guided double-stranded DNA nuclease that participates in the CRISPR-Cas immune defense against prokaryotic viruses. We describe the use of a Cas9 nuclease mutant that retains DNA-binding activity and can be engineered as a programmable transcription repressor by preventing the binding of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) to promoter sequences or as a transcription terminator by blocking the running RNAP. In addition, a fusion between the omega subunit of the RNAP and a Cas9 nuclease mutant directed to bind upstream promoter regions can achieve programmable transcription activation. The simple and efficient modulation of gene expression achieved by this technology is a useful asset for the study of gene networks \u2026"

Concerted genomic and experimental efforts on comprehensive characterization of Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems led to the identification of two new types and several subtypes. The newly characterized type VI systems are the first among the CRISPR-Cas variants to exclusively target RNA.

This obstacle has major scientific and clinical implications. For example, there is intense debate among physicians, neuroengineers and neuroscientists regarding the relevant cell types recruited during deep brain stimulation (DBS); moreover, many debilitating side effects of DBS likely result from lack of cell-type specificity. We describe here a novel optical neural interface technology that will allow neuroengineers to optically address specific cell types in vivo with millisecond temporal precision. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), an algal light-activated ion channel we developed for use in mammals, can give rise to safe, light-driven stimulation of CNS neurons on a timescale of milliseconds. Because ChR2 is \u2026"

Transcription activator\u2013like effectors (TALEs) from Xanthomonas sp. are site-specific DNA-binding proteins that can be readily designed to target new sequences. Because TALEs contain a large number of repeat domains, it can be difficult to synthesize new variants. Here we describe a method that overcomes this problem. We leverage codon degeneracy and type IIs restriction enzymes to generate orthogonal ligation linkers between individual repeat monomers, thus allowing full-length, customized, repeat domains to be constructed by hierarchical ligation. We synthesized 17 TALEs that are customized to recognize specific DNA-binding sites, and demonstrate that they can specifically modulate transcription of endogenous genes (SOX2 and KLF4) in human cells."

The effectors of two of the identified systems, C2c1 and C2c3, contain RuvC-like endonuclease domains distantly related to Cpf1. The third system, C2c2, contains an effector with two predicted HEPN RNase domains. Whereas production of mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) by C2c1 depends on tracrRNA, C2c2 crRNA maturation is tracrRNA independent. We found that C2c1 systems can mediate DNA interference in a 5\u2032-PAM-dependent fashion analogous to Cpf1. However, unlike Cpf1, which is a single-RNA-guided nuclease, C2c1 depends on both crRNA and tracrRNA for DNA cleavage. Finally, comparative analysis indicates that Class 2 CRISPR-Cas \u2026"

For zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), an engineered array of sequence-specific DNA binding domains are fused with the DNA nuclease Fok1 [1, 2]. These nucleases have been successful in genome modifications by generating double strand breaks (DSBs), which are then repaired through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) in different species, including mouse, tobacco and rice [3-5]. Recently, another breakthrough technology for genome editing, the CRISPR/Cas system, was developed. CRISPR (clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci are variable short spacers \u2026"

The new classification includes 2 classes, 6 types and 33 subtypes, compared with 5 types and 16 subtypes in 2015. A key development is the ongoing discovery of multiple, novel class 2 CRISPR\u2013Cas systems, which now include 3 types and 17 subtypes. A second major novelty is the discovery of numerous derived CRISPR\u2013Cas variants, often associated with mobile genetic elements that lack the nucleases required for interference. Some of these variants are involved in RNA-guided transposition, whereas others are predicted to perform functions distinct from adaptive immunity that remain to \u2026"

The DNA-binding domain of each TALE consists of tandem 34\u2013amino acid repeat modules that can be rearranged according to a simple cipher to target new DNA sequences. Customized TALEs can be used for a wide variety of genome engineering applications, including transcriptional modulation and genome editing. Here we describe a toolbox for rapid construction of custom TALE transcription factors (TALE-TFs) and nucleases (TALENs) using a hierarchical ligation procedure. This toolbox facilitates affordable and rapid construction of custom TALE-TFs and TALENs within 1 week and can be easily scaled up to construct TALEs for multiple targets in parallel. We also provide details for testing the activity in mammalian cells of custom TALE-TFs and TALENs using \u2026"

The algal protein Channelrhodopsin-2 offers a new and promising solution by permitting minimally invasive, genetically targeted and temporally precise photostimulation. Here we explore technological issues relevant to the temporal precision, spatial targeting and physiological implementation of ChR2, in the context of other photostimulation approaches to optical control of excitable cells."

The mutant cell pool rapidly generates metastases when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Enriched sgRNAs in lung metastases and late-stage primary tumors were found to target a small set of genes, suggesting that specific loss-of-function mutations drive tumor growth and metastasis. Individual sgRNAs and a small pool of 624 sgRNAs targeting the top-scoring genes from the primary screen dramatically accelerate metastasis. In all of these experiments, the effect of mutations on primary tumor growth positively correlates with the development of metastases. Our \u2026"

In this study, we demonstrate that the Cas13-based SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) platform can detect Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) in patient samples at concentrations as low as 1 copy per microliter. We developed HUDSON (heating unextracted diagnostic samples to obliterate nucleases), a protocol that pairs with SHERLOCK for viral detection directly from bodily fluids, enabling instrument-free DENV detection directly from patient samples in <2 hours. We further demonstrate that SHERLOCK can distinguish the four DENV serotypes, as well as region-specific strains of ZIKV from the 2015\u20132016 pandemic. Finally, we report the rapid (<1 week) design and testing of instrument-free assays to detect clinically relevant viral single-nucleotide \u2026"

Previously, we identified an erythroid enhancer of human BCL11A, subject to common genetic variation associated with the fetal haemoglobin level, the mouse orthologue of which is necessary for erythroid BCL11A expression. Here we develop pooled clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 guide RNA libraries to perform in situ saturating mutagenesis of the human and mouse enhancers. This approach reveals critical minimal features and discrete vulnerabilities of these enhancers. Despite conserved function of the composite enhancers, their architecture diverges. The crucial human sequences appear to be primate-specific. Through editing of \u2026"

However, the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme (SpCas9) requires an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for target recognition, thereby restricting the targetable genomic loci. Here, we report a rationally engineered SpCas9 variant (SpCas9-NG) that can recognize relaxed NG PAMs. The crystal structure revealed that the loss of the base-specific interaction with the third nucleobase is compensated by newly introduced non\u2013base-specific interactions, thereby enabling the NG PAM recognition. We showed that SpCas9-NG induces indels at endogenous target sites bearing NG PAMs in human cells. Furthermore, we found that the fusion of SpCas9-NG and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediates the C-to-T conversion at target sites with NG PAMs in human cells."

In cells transduced with a lentivirus carrying both wt-Cas9 and an EMX1-targeting sgRNA, we detected~ 95% indel frequency at the on-target site as well as mutations at four validated off-target sites (OT-1, 2, 3 and 4) OT-1= 2%, OT-2= 2%, OT-3 0.7% and OT-4= 38%. In comparison, on-target indel frequency in cells transduced with LSC-5 was~ 43% after 12 days of rapamycin treatment. In untreated cells, no significant difference in EMX1 on-target indels could be detected between LSC-5 and control samples.

We demonstrate cell-autonomous phenotypes directly linked to disease\u2014dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypoglycemia, lipodystrophy, motor-neuron death, and hepatitis C infection. We found little evidence of TALEN off-target effects, but each clonal line nevertheless harbors a significant number of unique mutations. Given the speed and ease with which we were able to derive and characterize these cell lines, we anticipate TALEN-mediated genome \u2026"

The genes that were most enriched in the screen have key roles in antigen presentation and interferon-\u03b3 signalling, and correlate with cytolytic activity in patient tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Among the genes validated using different cancer cell lines and antigens, we identified multiple loss-of-function mutations in APLNR, encoding the apelin receptor, in patient tumours that were refractory to immunotherapy. We show that APLNR interacts with JAK1, modulating interferon-\u03b3 \u2026"

Here, we provide step-by-step instructions for setting up SHERLOCK assays with recombinase-mediated polymerase pre-amplification of DNA or RNA and subsequent Cas13-or Cas12-mediated detection via fluorescence and colorimetric readouts that provide results in< 1 h with a setup time of less than 15 min. We also include guidelines for designing efficient CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and isothermal amplification primers \u2026"

However, the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas defense system, present in almost half of prokaryotic genomes, proves otherwise. Because of the everlasting parasite-host arms race, CRISPR-Cas has rapidly evolved through horizontal transfer of complete loci or individual modules, resulting in extreme structural and functional diversity. CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into two distinct classes that each consist of three types and multiple subtypes. We discuss recent advances in CRISPR-Cas research that reveal elaborate molecular mechanisms and provide for a plausible scenario of CRISPR-Cas evolution. We also briefly describe the latest developments of a wide range of CRISPR-based applications."

Cell type selectivity is obtained using Cre-dependent expression of the light-activated channel Channelrhodopsin-2. We also describe approaches for minimizing optical interference with simultaneous extracellular and intracellular recording.

Also largely unknown is the way in which viruses are targeted to cellular endocytic machinery. We have studied the entry mechanisms of influenza viruses by tracking the interaction of single viruses with cellular endocytic structures in real time using fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that influenza can exploit clathrin-mediated and clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytic pathways in parallel, both pathways leading to viral fusion with similar efficiency. Remarkably, viruses taking the clathrin-mediated pathway enter cells via the de novo formation of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) at viral-binding sites. CCP formation at these sites is much faster than elsewhere on the cell surface, suggesting a virus-induced CCP formation mechanism that may be commonly exploited by many \u2026"

AsCpf1 adopts a bilobed architecture, with the RNA-DNA heteroduplex bound inside the central channel. The structural comparison of AsCpf1 with Cas9, a type II CRISPR-Cas nuclease, reveals both striking similarity and major differences, thereby explaining their distinct functionalities. AsCpf1 contains the RuvC domain and a putative novel nuclease domain, which are responsible for cleaving the non-target and target strands, respectively, and for jointly generating staggered DNA double-strand breaks. AsCpf1 recognizes the 5\u2032-TTTN-3\u2032 protospacer adjacent motif by base and shape readout mechanisms. Our findings provide mechanistic \u2026"

Genome-wide functional screens using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout or dCas9 fusion-mediated inhibition/activation (CRISPRi/a) are powerful techniques for discovering phenotype-associated gene function. We systematically assessed the DNA sequence features that contribute to single guide RNA (sgRNA) efficiency in CRISPR-based screens. Leveraging the information from multiple designs, we derived a new sequence model for predicting sgRNA efficiency in CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments. Our model confirmed known features and suggested new features including a preference for cytosine at the cleavage site. The model was experimentally validated for sgRNA-mediated mutation rate and protein knockout efficiency. Tested on independent data sets, the model achieved significant results in both positive and negative \u2026"

Illumination of ChR2-positive neurons in brain slices produced photocurrents that generated action potentials within milliseconds and with precisely timed latencies. The number of light-evoked action potentials could be controlled by varying either the amplitude or duration of illumination. Furthermore, the frequency of light-evoked action potentials could be precisely controlled up to 30 Hz. Photostimulation also could evoke synaptic transmission between neurons, and, by scanning with a small laser light spot, we were able to map the spatial distribution of synaptic circuits connecting neurons within living cerebral cortex. We conclude that ChR2 is a genetically based photostimulation technology that permits analysis of \u2026"

We establish that these CRISPR-Cas systems can achieve RNA interference when heterologously expressed. Through a combination of biochemical and genetic experiments, we show that Cas13b processes its own CRISPR array with short and long direct repeats, cleaves target RNA, and exhibits collateral RNase activity. Using an E. coli essential gene screen, we demonstrate that Cas13b has a double-sided protospacer-flanking sequence and elucidate RNA secondary structure requirements for \u2026"

By using complementary optogenetic activation and targeted silencing of sensory neurons, we have demonstrated that a single class of neuron (class IV multidendritic neuron) is sufficient and necessary for triggering the unusual rolling behavior. In addition, we find that larvae have an innately encoded preference in the directionality of rolling. Surprisingly, the initial direction of rolling locomotion is toward the side of \u2026"

We found many of the known regulators of Tlr4 signaling, as well as dozens of previously unknown candidates that we validated. By measuring protein markers and mRNA profiles in DCs that are deficient in known or candidate genes, we classified the genes into three functional modules with distinct effects on the canonical responses to LPS and highlighted functions for the PAF complex and oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex.

While noncontingent activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental are (VTA) is sufficient for passive behavioral conditioning, it remains unknown whether the phasic dopaminergic signal is truly reinforcing. In this study, we first targeted the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to dopaminergic neurons of the VTA and optimized optogenetically evoked dopamine transients. Second, we showed that phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in freely moving mice causally enhances positive reinforcing actions in a food-seeking operant task. Interestingly, such effect was not found in the absence of food reward. We further found that phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons is sufficient to reactivate previously extinguished food-seeking behavior in the absence of \u2026"

Here we characterize a CRISPR-associated transposase from cyanobacteria Scytonema hofmanni (ShCAST) that consists of Tn7-like transposase subunits and the type V-K CRISPR effector (Cas12k). ShCAST catalyzes RNA-guided DNA transposition by unidirectionally inserting segments of DNA 60 to 66 base pairs downstream of the protospacer. ShCAST integrates DNA into targeted sites in the Escherichia coli genome with frequencies of up to 80% without positive selection. This work expands our understanding of the functional diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems and establishes a paradigm for precision DNA insertion."

Here, we report the 1.7 \u00c5 resolution crystal structures of Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9), one of the largest Cas9 orthologs, in complex with a guide RNA and its PAM-containing DNA targets. A structural comparison of FnCas9 with other Cas9 orthologs revealed striking conserved and divergent features among distantly related CRISPR-Cas9 systems. We found that FnCas9 recognizes the 5\u2032-NGG-3\u2032 PAM, and used the structural information to create a variant that can recognize the more relaxed 5\u2032-YG-3\u2032 PAM. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the FnCas9-ribonucleoprotein \u2026"

It could be engineered to function in eukaryotic cells as a fast, low-cost, efficient, and scalable tool for manipulating genomic sequences. In this chapter, detailed protocols are described for harnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes to enable RNA-guided genome engineering applications in mammalian cells. We present all relevant methods including the initial site selection, molecular cloning, delivery of guide RNAs (gRNAs) and Cas9 into mammalian cells, verification of target cleavage, and assays for detecting genomic modification including indels and homologous recombination. These tools provide researchers with new instruments that accelerate both forward and reverse genetics efforts."

Newly developed genome engineering tools may offer the ability to directly cleave viral DNA, thereby promoting viral clearance. Here, we show that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can specifically target and cleave conserved regions in the HBV genome, resulting in robust suppression of viral gene expression and replication. Upon sustained expression of Cas9 and appropriately chosen guide RNAs, we demonstrate cleavage of cccDNA by Cas9 and a dramatic reduction in both cccDNA and other parameters of viral gene expression and replication. Thus, we show that directly targeting viral episomal DNA is a novel therapeutic approach to control the virus and possibly cure patients."

We developed a CRISPR screen using ~18,000 single guide RNAs targeting >700 kilobases surrounding the genes NF1, NF2, and CUL3, which are involved in BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma. We find that noncoding locations that modulate drug resistance also harbor predictive hallmarks of noncoding function. With a subset of regions at the CUL3 locus, we demonstrate that engineered mutations alter transcription factor occupancy and long-range and local epigenetic environments, implicating these sites in gene regulation and chemotherapeutic resistance. Through our expansion of the potential of pooled CRISPR screens, we provide tools for genomic discovery and for elucidating biologically relevant mechanisms of gene regulation."

We apply BLISS to profile endogenous and exogenous DSBs in low-input samples of cancer cells, embryonic stem cells and liver tissue. We demonstrate the sensitivity of BLISS by assessing the genome-wide off-target activity of two CRISPR-associated RNA-guided endonucleases, Cas9 and Cpf1, observing that Cpf1 has higher \u2026"

Here we describe transgenic mice that express halorhodopsin (NpHR), a light-driven chloride pump that can be used to silence neuronal activity via light. Using the Thy-1 promoter to target NpHR expression to neurons, we found that neurons in these mice expressed high levels of NpHR-YFP and that illumination of cortical pyramidal neurons expressing NpHR-YFP led to rapid, reversible photoinhibition of action potential firing in these cells. However, NpHR-YFP expression led to the formation of numerous intracellular blebs, which may disrupt neuronal \u2026"

Here, we report a cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) RNA editor, referred to as RNA Editing for Specific C-to-U Exchange (RESCUE), by directly evolving ADAR2 into a cytidine deaminase. RESCUE doubles the number of mutations targetable by RNA editing and enables modulation of phosphosignaling-relevant residues. We apply RESCUE to drive \u03b2-catenin activation and cellular growth. Furthermore, RESCUE retains A-to-I editing activity, enabling multiplexed C-to-U and A-to-I editing through the use of tailored guide RNAs."

Here we explore the diversity of the Cas12b family and identify a promising candidate for human gene editing from Bacillus hisashii, BhCas12b. However, at 37\u2009\u00b0C, wild-type BhCas12b preferentially nicks the non-target DNA strand instead of forming a double strand break, leading to lower editing efficiency. Using a combination of approaches, we identify gain-of-function mutations for BhCas12b that overcome this limitation. Mutant BhCas12b facilitates robust genome editing in human cell lines and ex vivo in primary human T cells, and exhibits greater specificity compared to S. pyogenes Cas9. This work establishes a third RNA-guided nuclease platform, in addition to Cas9 and Cpf1/Cas12a \u2026"

Optical stimulation of genetically targeted neurons expressing the light sensitive channel protein Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) has recently been reported as a means for millisecond temporal control of neuronal spiking activities with cell-type selectivity. This offers the prospect of enabling local delivery of optical stimulation and the simultaneous monitoring of the neural activity by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We report here a novel dual-modality hybrid device, which consists of a tapered coaxial optical waveguide ('optrode') integrated into a 100 element intra-cortical multi-electrode recording array. We first demonstrate the dual optical delivery and electrical recording \u2026"

Using integrated comparative genomics and machine learning techniques, we identify key genomic features that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses behind the two previous deadly coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), from less pathogenic coronaviruses. These features include enhancement of the nuclear localization signals in the nucleocapsid protein and distinct inserts in the spike glycoprotein that appear to be associated with high case fatality rate of these coronaviruses as well as the host switch from animals to \u2026"

The role of the LH to VTA projection in reward-seeking behavior can be informed by using optogenetic techniques to dissociate the actions of LH neurons from those of other descending forebrain inputs to the VTA. In the present study, we identify the effect of neurotensin (NT), one of the most abundant peptides in the LH to VTA projection, on excitatory synaptic transmission in the VTA and reward-seeking behavior. Mice displayed robust intracranial self-stimulation of LH to VTA fibers, an operant behavior mediated by NT 1 receptors (Nts1) and NMDA receptors. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of VTA dopamine neurons demonstrated that NT (10 nm) potentiated NMDA-mediated EPSCs via Nts1 \u2026"

We analyzed more than 300,000 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the region of the nucleocapsid protein associated with nuclear localization signals (NLS) are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety \u2026"

Here, we investigate brain-state-dependent neocortical synaptic interactions in vivo by combining the specificity of optogenetic stimulation with the precision of whole-cell recordings from postsynaptic excitatory glutamatergic neurons and GFP-labeled inhibitory GABAergic neurons targeted through two-photon microscopy.Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) stimulation of excitatory layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons evoked larger and faster depolarizing postsynaptic potentials and more synaptically driven action potentials in fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons compared to both non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons and postsynaptic \u2026"

Technologies that facilitate functional dissection of distinct brain circuits are necessary for systematic identification of disease origin and therapy. Recent developments in optogenetics technology have begun to address this challenge by enabling precise perturbation of distinct cell types based on molecular signatures, functional projections, and intracellular biochemical signaling pathways. With high temporal precision and reversible neuromodulation, optogenetics promises to improve existing disease models and advance our understanding of psychiatric conditions. In this review, we describe the current state of molecular optogenetic tools and future directions of development."

While the BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is hypothesized to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviors 4, 6, 7,, our understanding of the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behavior. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibers from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. We show that optical stimulation of the BLA-to-NAc pathway in mice reinforces behavioral responding to earn additional optical stimulations of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of BLA-to-NAc glutamatergic fibers required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type, but not D2-type, receptor signaling. Brief optical \u2026"

Transcription activator like effectors (TALEs) from Xanthomonas sp. present a promising platform for designing sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. Here we describe a robust and rapid method for overcoming the difficulty of constructing TALE repeat domains. We synthesized 17 designer TALEs (dTALEs) that are customized to recognize specific DNA binding sites, and demonstrate that dTALEs can specifically modulate transcription of endogenous genes (Sox2 and Klf4) from the native genome in human cells. dTALEs provide a designable DNA targeting platform for the interrogation and engineering of biological systems."

                "abstract": "Background The genetic analysis of behavior in Drosophila melanogaster has linked genes controlling neuronal connectivity and physiology to specific neuronal circuits underlying a variety of innate behaviors. We investigated the circuitry underlying the adult startle response, using photoexcitation of neurons that produce the abnormal chemosensory jump 6 (acj6) transcription factor. This transcription factor has previously been shown to play a role in neuronal pathfinding and neurotransmitter modality, but the role of acj6 neurons in the adult startle response was largely unknown.  Principal Findings We show that the activity of these neurons is necessary for a wild-type startle response and that excitation is sufficient to generate a synthetic escape response. Further, we show that this synthetic response is still sensitive to the dose of acj6 suggesting that that acj6 mutation alters neuronal activity as well as connectivity and neurotransmitter production.  Results/Significance These results extend the understanding of the role of acj6 and of the adult startle response in general. They also demonstrate the usefulness of activity-dependent characterization of neuronal circuits underlying innate behaviors in Drosophila, and the utility of integrating genetic analysis into modern circuit analysis techniques."

By combining genetic targeting with an optical fiber system, neurons expressing light-sensitive microbial opsins in the mammalian brain can be directly modulated in vivo, and thereby allowing investigators to probe the causal role of specific cell populations and activity patterns in behavioral tests. Here we compare the current set of microbial opsins and suggest considerations for choosing the most optimal opsin based on experimental needs. We also provide a detailed protocol for the construction of the optical fiber system for conducting optogenetics experiments in vivo."
