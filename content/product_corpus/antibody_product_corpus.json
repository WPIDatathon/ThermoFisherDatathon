    "Dynabeads: Protein A Magnetic Beads": "Immunoprecipitation Dynabeads Protein A are uniform 28 µm superparamagnetic beads with recombinant Protein A ∼45 kDa covalently coupled to the surface Dynabeads Protein A provide a superior alternative to Sepharose resin or agarose resin for immunoprecipitation IP and both manual and automated protocols are available  IP in less than 40 minutes  High target protein yield with low antibody consumption  Very low nonspecific binding with high signaltonoise ratio  No columns centrifugations or timeconsuming preclearing required  High reproducibility and high throughput compatible with KingFisher instruments Manual Dynabeads separation is fast and easy to perform The manual protocol is simple and can be performed in under 40 minutes First the antibody for the target protein is incubated with the Dynabeads Protein A in a tube for 10 minutes Excess antibody is washed away by placing the tube in a DynaMag magnet and removing the supernatant The antibodycoated beads can then be used for a variety of downstream applications including IP CoIP chromatin IP ChIP RNA IP RIP smallscale IgG purification and protein purification Bound material is easily collected using a DynaMag magnet due to the unique magnetic properties of the Dynabeads The recombinant protein A on the beads contains no albumin binding sites thus albumin is not copurified during the procedure The IP is fast and gives high yield high reproducibility and very little nonspecific binding thus preclearing is not required Automated Dynabeads separation helps increase throughput and reduces handson time If you are working with several samples in parallel the number of washing steps and the handson time increases proportionally with the number of samples Pipetting and other manual handling tend to be less consistent than automation when working with many samples at a time To better handle a medium to highthroughput number of samples reduce handson time and secure high reproducibility we have developed IP protocols for the KingFisher Flex and KingFisher Duo Prime instruments The automated protocols replicate the manual protocols obtaining equally high target protein yield and the same low nonspecific binding and high reproducibility It doesn’t matter if you are working with 10 or 96 samples the IP protocol is less than 40 minutes regardless Just load the reagents on the plates push the “Start” button and by the time you have prepared for downstream analysis the IP is done Some optimization eg incubation times might be necessary depending on your antibody and the abundance andor specificity of your target protein  Use the KingFisher Duo instrument for low to medium throughput 112 samplesrun  Use the KingFisher Flex instrument for high throughput 1296 samplesrun See automated protocols Watch a video about the KingFisher Flex instrument Gentle separation causes minimal physical stress to proteins The magnetic separation technology utilized by Dynabeads Protein A is rapid and gentle causing minimal physical stress to your target proteins This permits the isolation and concentration of labile composites that might otherwise dissociate or be damaged by proteases during long incubation times Native protein conformation and large protein complexes are preserved Binding strength and capacity Dynabeads Protein A allow for isolation of most mammalian immunoglobulins Ig The amount of Ig captured depends on the concentration of Ig in the starting sample and on the type and source of the Ig 100 µL of Dynabeads Protein A will isolate approximately 25 30 µg human IgG from a sample containing 20 200 µg IgGmL Predominant Fcbinding allows optimal Ig orientation The antibodies bind to the outer smooth surface of the beads thus are not trapped in large pores as with Sepharoseagarosebased beads All antibodies are available for protein binding so low amounts of antibody are required while still obtaining the same high yield of target protein The smooth bead surface is also responsible for the low nonspecific binding that Dynabeads are known for",
