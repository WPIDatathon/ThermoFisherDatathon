    "Monomeric Avidin Agarose":"Biotin-Tagged Molecule Monomeric Avidin Agarose Avidin Thermo Scientific Pierce Monomeric Avidin Agarose is ideal for purifying biotinylated proteins peptides and other molecules Features of Monomeric Avidin Agarose • Nondenaturing—purifies biotinylated products using mild elution conditions 2 mM free biotin • Reusable—Monomeric Avidin Agarose can be regenerated and reused at least 10 times with only a marginal loss in biotin binding capacity approximately 25 decrease per regeneration • Specific—retains biotinbinding specificity and low nonspecific binding of native avidin • Flexible—bind samples in a variety of physiological buffers and elute either with 01M glycine or by competition with 2 mM biotin • Good binding capacity—greater than 12 mg biotinylated BSAmL resin The Immobilized Monomeric Avidin protein binds biotin with high specificity and moderate affinity allowing nonbiotin molecules to be washed away and then the bound biotinlabeled molecules to be competitively eluted using 2 mM biotin in phosphate buffered saline PBS This technique provides the gentlest elution conditions for biotinylated protein purification and avoids the contamination and other problems associated with traditional avidin and streptavidin methods The monomeric avidin column can then be regenerated by using 01M glycine to strip the column of residual bound biotin without losing the ability to bind another biotinylated sample With typical avidin or streptavidin the biotinbinding affinity Kd 1015M is so great that purification with these traditional media require denaturing conditions for elution such as 8M Guanidine·HCl at pH 15 or boiling in reducing SDSPAGE sample loading buffer In addition to their adverse effects on the biotinylated protein of interest such harsh elution conditions typically cause extraneous proteins ie the avidin or streptavidin subunits to strip from the resin and coelute with the desired purification product By contrast when avidin is coupled to a resin eg crosslinked beaded agarose or UltraLink Resin as the subunit monomer its specificity for biotin is retained but its biotinbinding affinity decreases to a level Kd 108M that is conducive to subsequent elution"
