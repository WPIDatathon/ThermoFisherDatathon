    "POROS XS Resin" : "Antibody purification involves isolation of antibody from serum polyclonal antibody ascites fluid or from the culture supernatant of a hybridoma cell line monoclonal antibody Purification methods range from very crude to highly specific The level of purification necessary to obtain usable antibody depends upon the intended applications for the antibody Antibodies may be purified by class eg IgG without regard to antigen specificity or affinity purified to an immobilized antigen that is antibody specific ligands and formats to purify total or specific antibodies from serum ascites fluid or tissue culture supernatant Our portfolio is designed to meet smallscale screening to largescale bioprocess needs magnetic beads loose resin spin columns and kits FPLC cartridges and well filter plates enable antibody purification Protein A Protein A alkaline stable Protein G Protein A/G Protein L Agarose Magnetic beads POROS resin Melon gel The separation of antibodies from complex mixtures can be achieved using chromatographic or nonchromatographic techniques The purification of antibodies using chromatography involves the separation of antibodies or antibodyderived molecules present in complex mixtures by passing them through a solid phase eg silica resin or beads monolithic columns or cellulose membranes and allowing the antibodies to bind or pass through depending on whether bindandelute or flowthrough chromatographic methods are employed Chromatographic methodologies can incorporate different separation techniques such as affinitytag binding ionexchange sizeexclusion chromatography or immunoaffinity chromatography However in a concerted effort to become less reliant on chromatographybased separations owing to the high cost of largescale production nonchromatographicbased techniques such as precipitation flocculation crystallization filtration and aqueous twophase partitioning are now becoming more popular This review details current chromatographic and nonchromatographic methodologies used for the purification of antibodies and expands on technological advancements and practical uses that have recently been reported",
