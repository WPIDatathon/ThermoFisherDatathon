Pierce (SCX) Spin Columns

"Pierce (SCX) Spin Columns Strong cation exchange membrane Binding capacity Salt tolerance Realize shorter diffusion times, higher protein recovery, and intact biological activity of eluted samples with Pierce Strong Cation Exchange and Strong Anion Exchange spin columns. Unlike resin-based column chromatography, these columns utilize ion exchange chromatography to separate molecules based on differences in their accessible surface charges.
Pierce Strong Cation Exchange and Strong Anion Exchange spin columns use membrane-adsorption as the chromatographic method of choice to fractionate proteins based on their charge differences. The column matrix has a highly porous structure, with pores larger than 3000 nm, giving proteins ready accessibility to the membrane's charged ligands. These adsorptive membranes maintain high efficiencies at high flow rates and during fractionation of large biomolecules with small diffusivities.

Ion chromatography is widely preferred in the pre-fractionation or purification of a target protein from crude biological samples. Interactions between molecules and active sites on the ion exchange membrane occur in a convective manner via pores, which shortens diffusion time when compared with fluid inside the pores of a resin particle. Also, the relatively mild binding and eluting conditions of this separation method produce high protein recovery with intact biological activity.Pierce strong ion exchange spin columns enable rapid protein fractionation and sample preparation based on charge differences. There are two available formats:
• Mini Format: for binding up to 4 mg (500 µL capacity)
• Maxi Format: for binding up to 80 mg (20 mL capacity)

Features of Pierce strong ion exchange spin columns:
• Fast and simple—membrane-based spin format eliminates column packing
• Convenient and expandable—centrifugal format enables convenient processing of multiple samples in parallel
• Robust—membrane adsorber spin columns do not crack or run dry
• Low bed volume—small membrane adsorber bed volumes make working with low buffer volumes possible, leading to concentrated elution fractions

Strong ion exchange spin column applications
• Pre-fractionation of proteins in lysate
• Scouting purification conditions for new protein preparation protocols
• Removal of endotoxins from monoclonal antibodies
• Polishing His-tagged proteins after metal chelate chromatography
• Purification and concentration of proteins
• Purification of antibodies from serum, ascites, or tissue culture supernatant
• Removal of detergent from protein solutions
• Sample preparation before 1D or 2D PAGE
• Purification of phosphopeptides before MS analysis

POROS XS Resin

"POROS XS Resin Strong cation exchange (SCX) resin Surface charge Format Binding capacity Salt tolerance loose resin
POROS™ XS Strong Cation Exchange Resin is the first high-capacity, high-resolution resin that allows loading to more than 100 mg/mL capacity in the presence of up to 15 mS/cm NaCl, while delivering unprecedented separation capability. A major improvement on traditional cation exchangers, POROS XS resin sets the standard for cation exchange chromatography.

• Dynamic binding capacity leads to reduced column size, smaller footprint, decreased buffer usage, and reduced cycling
• High resolution supports better product yield and improved impurity clearance
• Robust salt tolerance allows improved process flexibility, alignment, and process flow streamlining
• Low back pressure and linear pressure responses help improve scalability
• Rigid polymeric bead with covalent surface chemistry makes for easier handling and packing, and superior physical and chemical stability, resulting in a robust manufacturing process

Dynamic binding capacity
POROS XS resin has a high binding capacity of more than 100 mg/mL, at 5 breakthrough, over a broad range of process conditions.Higher dynamic binding capacity was achieved by optimizing the base bead pore structure and surface chemistry.

High resolution
Using an optimized 50 µm particle size, POROS XS resin maintains the superior resolving capacity of POROS™ HS resin while overcoming the challenging impurity levels associated with high titer processes. Resolution is consistent across a wide range of operating flow rates and is maintained independent of protein load.

Robust salt tolerance
POROS XS resin has high and consistent protein capacity across a broad range of salt concentrations up to 150 mM NaCl (15 mS/cm conductivity). The ability to load columns under higher conductivity reduces or helps eliminate the dilution of column feed streams or the removal of unit operations, such as tangential flow filtration. The optimized surface ionic capacity of POROS XS resin minimizes competitive binding between the protein of interest and the counterion, resulting in superior salt tolerance.

POROS 50 HQ Resin

"POROS 50 HQ Resin Strong anion exchange (SAX) resin Format loose resin POROS™ 50-micron resins are available for low pressure applications, including large scale downstream bioprocessing. POROS HQ is based on a quaternized polyethyleneimine functional group yielding a high capacity, Perfusion Chromatography™ resin designed for the separation and purification of biomolecules. POROS Perfusion Chromatography resins A high performance chromatography resin for analytical to process scale separations. Higher productivity—high throughput and high dynamic capacity associated with Perfusion Chromatography Chemical stability—allows aggressive cleaning and sanitization Enhanced biomolecule access—provided via large pores, ranging between 500-10000 Å Polystyrenedivinylbenzene particles—yield a robust, easily packable matrix Develop better separations methods in a shorter time frame—the speed of Perfusion Chromatography technology reduces weeks of experimentation to only a few hours of work, so you have plenty of time to explore all the variables of your separation Reduce time-consuming sample prep
You can replace many sample preparation steps with high-speed Perfusion Chromatography technology. For instance, dialysis of large volumes of material can be replaced by high flow rate processing of the dilute sample. Elution in a small volume of new buffer accomplishes both buffer exchange and concentration.

Create novel assays for more efficient analysis
Perfusion Chromatography technology is not limited to standard modes of separation. Both enzymes and affinity ligands can be immobilized on POROS media. By combining rapid on-column protein digestions with rapid on-column immunoassays and chromatographic separations, you can create entirely new assays with unlimited potential.

High capacity, high resolution, high speed
In contrast to conventional chromatography media, POROS Perfusion Chromatography resin particles are engineered to have two discreet classes of pores. Large “throughpores” allow convection flow to occur through the particles themselves, quickly carrying sample molecules to short “diffusive” pores inside. By reducing the distance over which diffusion needs to occur, the time required for sample molecules to interact with interior binding sites is also reduced. Diffusion is no longer limiting and flow rates can be dramatically increased—without compromising resolution or capacity. Separations can be achieved at 1,000 to 5,000 cm/hr compared to 50 to 360 cm/hr for conventional resins.
