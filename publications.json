Suicide is likely to become a more pressing concern as the pandemic spreads and has longer-term effects on the general population, the economy, and vulnerable groups. Preventing suicide therefore needs urgent consideration. The response must capitalise on, but extend beyond, general mental health policies and practices. There is some evidence that deaths by suicide increased in the USA during the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic2 and among older people in Hong Kong during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. 3 The current context is different and evolving.

Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of methodological factors on heterogeneity in NSSI prevalence estimates, explore changes over time, and estimate overall international NSSI prevalence. Results showed that methodological factors contributed over half (51.6%) of the heterogeneity in prevalence estimates, and, after adjusting for these factors, NSSI prevalence did not increase over time. Overall, pooled NSSI prevalence was 17.2% among adolescents, 13.4% among young adults, and 5.5% among adults. Clearly, development of standardized methodology in NSSI research is crucial if accurate estimates are desired."

This estimate was incomplete as it excluded burden resulting from the increased risk of suicide captured elsewhere in GBD 2010's mutually exclusive list of diseases and injuries. Here, we estimate suicide DALYs attributable to mental and substance use disorders.  Methods Relative-risk estimates of suicide due to mental and substance use disorders and the global prevalence of each disorder were used to estimate population attributable fractions. These were adjusted for global differences in the proportion of suicide due to mental and substance use disorders compared to other causes then multiplied by suicide DALYs reported in GBD 2010 to estimate attributable DALYs (with 95% uncertainty).  Results Mental and substance use disorders were responsible for 22.5 million (14.8\u201329.8 million) of the 36.2 million (26.5\u201344.3 million) DALYs allocated to suicide in 2010. Depression was responsible for the largest proportion of suicide DALYs (46.1% (28.0%\u201360.8%)) and anorexia nervosa the lowest (0.2% (0.02%\u20130.5%)). DALYs occurred throughout the lifespan, with the largest proportion found in Eastern Europe and Asia, and males aged 20\u201330 years. The inclusion of attributable suicide DALYs would have increased the overall burden of mental and substance use disorders (assigned to them in GBD 2010 as a direct cause) from 7.4% (6.2%\u20138.6%) to 8.3% (7.1%\u20139.6%) of global DALYs, and would have changed the global ranking \u2026"

Method A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of those studies that assessed duration of unemployment as a risk factor for suicide. Studies considered as eligible for inclusion were population-based cohort or case-control designs; population-based ecological designs, or hospital based clinical cohort or case-control designs published in the year 1980 or later.   Results The review identified 16 eligible studies, out of a possible 10,358 articles resulting from a search of four databases: PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus and Proquest. While all 16 studies measured unemployment duration in different ways, a common finding was that longer duration of unemployment was related to greater risk of suicide and suicide attempt. A random effects meta-analysis on a subsample of six cohort studies indicated that the pooled relative risk of suicide in relation to average follow-up time after unemployment was 1.70 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.18). However, results also suggested a possible habituation effect to unemployment over time, with the greatest risk of suicide occurring within five years of unemployment compared to the employed population (RR = 2.50, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.17). Relative risk appeared to decline in studies of those unemployed between 12 and 16 years compared to those currently employed (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33).   Conclusion Findings suggest that long-term unemployment is associated with greater incidence of suicide \u2026"

Method A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on five population-based cohort studies where temporal relationships could be clearly ascertained. Results Results of the meta-analysis showed that unemployment was associated with a significantly higher relative risk (RR) of suicide before adjustment for prior mental health [RR 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33\u20131.83].

Moreover, the systems overlapped to a considerable extent, thereby entailing a duplication of effort.

This study investigates the association between maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and key perinatal outcomes, including birth weight, gestational age at birth, breastfeeding indicators and postnatal depressive symptoms.   Method A retrospective cohort of mothers (N = 17,564) of all infants born in public health facilities within South Western Sydney Local Health District and Sydney Local Health District in 2014, in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, was enumerated from routinely collected antenatal data to investigate the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Antenatal depressive symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Logistic regression models that adjusted for confounders were conducted to determine associations between antenatal depressive symptoms and low birth weight, early gestational age at birth (<37 weeks), breast feeding indicators and postnatal depressive symptoms.   Results The prevalence of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy was 7.0% in the cohort, and was significantly associated with postnatal depressive symptoms [Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) = 6.4, 95% CI: 4.8\u20138.7, P<0.001]. Antenatal depressive symptoms was associated with a higher odds of low birth weight [AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2\u20132.3, P = 0.003] and a gestational age at birth of <37 weeks [AOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1\u20131.7, P = 0.018] compared to women who reported lower EPDS scores in antenatal period \u2026"

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with neonatal death in Nigeria using the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). Neonatal deaths of all singleton live-born infants between 2003 and 2008 were extracted from the 2008 NDHS. The 2008 NDHS was a multi-stage cluster sample survey of 36,298 households. Of these households, survival information of 27,147 singleton live-borns was obtained, including 996 cases of neonatal mortality. The risk of death was adjusted for confounders relating to individual, household, and community level factors using Cox regression. Multivariable analyses indicated that a higher birth order of newborns with a short birth interval\u2009\u2264\u20092 years (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20092.19, confidence interval [CI]: 1.68\u20132.84) and newborns with a higher birth order with a longer birth interval\u2009>\u20092 years (HR\u2009=\u20091.36, CI: 1.05\u20131.78) were significantly associated with neonatal mortality. Other significant factors that affected neonatal deaths included neonates born to mothers younger than 20 years (HR\u2009=\u20094.07, CI: 2.83\u20135.86), neonates born to mothers residing in rural areas compared with urban residents (HR\u2009=\u20091.26, CI: 1.03\u20131.55), male neonates (HR\u2009=\u20091.30, CI: 1.12\u20131.53), mothers who perceived their neonate\u2019s body size to be smaller than the average size (HR\u2009=\u20092.10, CI: 1.77\u20132.50), and mothers who delivered their neonates by caesarean section (HR\u2009=\u20092.80, CI: 1.84\u20134.25).

Pooled 2003, 2008 and 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data were used to examine the impact of water and sanitation on deaths of children aged 0\u201328 days, 1\u201311 months, and 12\u201359 months using Cox regression analysis. Survival information of 63,844 children was obtained, which included 6285 deaths of children under 5 years old; there were 2254 cases of neonatal mortality (0\u201328 days), 1859 cases of post-neonatal mortality (1\u201311 months) and 2,172 cases of child mortality (1\u20134 years old). Over a 10-year period, the odds of neonatal, post-neonatal and child deaths significantly reduced by 31%, 41% and 47% respectively. The risk of mortality from both unimproved water and sanitation was significantly higher by 38% (Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) = 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14\u20131.66) for post-neonatal mortality and 24% (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04\u20131.48) for child mortality. The risk of neonatal mortality increased by 6% (HR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.85\u20131.23) but showed no significant effect. The Nigerian government needs to invest more in water and sanitation to reduce preventable child deaths."

We aimed to investigate the association between infant feeding practices and diarrhoea in sub-Saharan African countries with high diarrhoea mortality.   Method The study used the most recent Demographic and Health Survey datasets collected in nine sub-Saharan African countries with high diarrhoea mortality, namely: Burkina Faso (2010, N = 9,733); Demographic Republic of Congo (2013; N = 10,458); Ethiopia (2013, N = 7,251); Kenya (2014, N = 14,034); Mali (2013, N = 6,365); Niger (2013, N = 7,235); Nigeria (2013, N = 18,539); Tanzania (2010, N = 5,013); and Uganda (2010, N = 4,472). Multilevel logistic regression models that adjusted for cluster and sampling weights were used to investigate the association between infant feeding practices and diarrhoea in these nine African countries.   Results Diarrhoea prevalence was lower among children whose mothers practiced early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive and predominant breastfeeding. Early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding were significantly associated with lower risk of diarrhoea (OR = 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77\u20130.85, P<0.001 and OR = 0.50; 95%CI: 0.43\u20130.57, respectively). In contrast, introduction of complementary foods (OR = 1.31; 95%CI: 1.14\u20131.50) and continued breastfeeding at one year (OR = 1.27; 95%CI: 1.05\u20131.55) were significantly associated with a higher risk of diarrhoea \u2026"

It is possible that a major government youth suicide prevention initiative, the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy (NYSPS), implemented during 1995\u20131999 may have influenced the decline. In this article, we examine time trends in age- and means-specific male and female Australian suicide rates in relation to unemployment rates and the NYSPS. Based on Australian suicide data over the period 1966\u20132003, we assess secular changes in the 20\u201324 year male suicide to total (crude) male suicide rate ratio in relation to the NYSPS, using interrupted time series analysis (ARIMA), since this was previously found to be significantly associated with the 20\u201324 year male unemployment to total employment ratio.Results show that a dramatic reduction in Australian young male (aged 20\u201334 years) suicide has occurred \u2026"

The study used routinely collected perinatal data on all live births in 2014 (N\u2009=\u200917,564) in public health facilities in two Local Health Districts in Sydney, Australia. The prevalence of mother\u2019s breastfeeding intention, skin-to-skin contact, EBF at birth, discharge and early postnatal period (1\u20134 weeks postnatal) were estimated. Multivariate logistic regression models that adjusted for confounders were conducted to determine association between cessation of EBF in the early postnatal period and socio-demographic, psychosocial and health service factors. Most mothers intended to breastfeed (92%), practiced skin-to-skin contact (81%), exclusively breastfed  at delivery (90%) and discharge (89%). However, the prevalence of EBF declined (by 27%) at the early postnatal period (62%). Younger mothers (<20 years) and mothers who smoked cigarettes in pregnancy were more likely to cease EBF in the early postnatal period compared to older mothers (20\u201339 years) and those who reported not smoking cigarettes, respectively [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =2.7, 95%CI 1.9\u20133.8, P <0.001 and AOR\u2009=\u20092.5, 95%CI 2.1\u20133.0, P <0.001, respectively]. Intimate partner violence, assisted delivery, low socio-economic status, pre-existing maternal health problems and a lack of partner support were also associated with early cessation of EBF in the postnatal period.

Of particular promise is the potential of these methods to improve operational aspects of healthcare capacity and delivery, analyse policy options for health system reform and guide investments to address complex public health problems. Because it lends itself to a participatory approach, system dynamics modelling has been a particularly appealing method that aims to align stakeholder understanding of the underlying causes of a problem and achieve consensus for action. The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness of system dynamics modelling for health policy, and explore the range and nature of its application.Method: A systematic search was conducted to identify articles published up to April 2015 from the PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Embase, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases. The grey literature was also searched. Papers eligible for inclusion were those that described applications of system dynamics modelling to support health policy at any level of government.Results and discussion: Six papers were identified, comprising eight case studies of the application of system dynamics modelling to support health policy. No analytic studies were found that examined the effectiveness of this type of modelling. Only three examples engaged multidisciplinary stakeholders in collective model building. Stakeholder participation in model building reportedly facilitated development of a common \u2018mental map\u2019of the health problem, resulting in consensus about optimal policy strategy and garnering support for \u2026"

Suicide rates for males (all ages and young adults) were significantly higher in rural areas compared to urban areas. Urban\u2013rural suicide rate differences in males were rendered nonsignificant after adjustment for migrant and area socioeconomic status. Adjusting for mental disorder prevalence, in addition to migrant status, reduced the excess suicide risk in rural areas; the excess was reduced further with addition of mental health service utilization. The implications of this study are that socioeconomic circumstances in rural populations contribute to higher male suicide rates compared to urban areas, but these conditions may be partly mediated by mental disorder prevalence and mental health service utilization."

As sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may be important co-factors in HIV transmission nationally, it is timely to conduct a systematic review of STI prevalences to inform national policy on sexual health and HIV/STI prevention.   Methodology/Principal Findings We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of HIV and STI prevalences in PNG, reported in peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed publications for the period 1950\u20132010. Prevalence estimates were stratified by study site (community or clinic-based), geographic area and socio-demographic characteristics. The search strategy identified 105 reports, of which 25 studies (10 community-based; 10 clinic-based; and 5 among self-identified female sex workers) reported STI prevalences and were included in the systematic review. High prevalences of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomonas were reported in all settings, particularly among female sex workers, where pooled estimates of 26.1%, 33.6%, 33.1% and 39.3% respectively were observed. Pooled HIV prevalence in community-based studies was 1.8% (95% CI:1.2\u20132.4) in men; 2.6% (95% CI:1.7\u20133.5) in women; and 11.8% (95% CI:5.8\u201317.7) among female sex workers.   Conclusions/Significance The epidemiology of STIs and HIV in PNG shows considerable heterogeneity by geographical setting and sexual risk group. Prevalences from community-based studies in PNG were higher than in many other countries in the Asia-Pacific. A renewed focus on \u2026"

Ease of availability of high-lethality suicide methods, such as pesticides and firearms, contributes to the overall incidence and is an important target for suicide prevention. This study investigates whether changes in the distribution of methods of suicide have contributed to the recent reduction in suicide in China.Suicide rates (2006\u20132013) were calculated using the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points system, stratified by gender, age group, and urban-rural residence, to investigate trends in suicide over the study period. Multilevel negative binomial regression models were used to investigate associations between socio-demographic factors and method-specific suicide.The most common method of suicide in China for both males and females was pesticide poisoning, followed by hanging. All methods declined over the study \u2026"

Suicide rates (per 100,000) were adjusted for confounding by sex, age, country-of-birth and the mediating effects of area SES, using Poisson regression models. Male suicide rates in metropolitan, rural and remote areas diverged significantly over time, especially in young males (15\u201324 years).

The study aimed to examine the trends and determinants of early initiation of breastfeeding and EBF in Ethiopia between 2000 and 2016. Using the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data for the years: 2000 (n\u2009=\u20093680), 2005 (n\u2009=\u20093528), 2011 (n\u2009=\u20094037) and 2016 (n\u2009=\u20093861), trends in early initiation of breastfeeding and EBF were estimated. Multivariate logistic regression models that adjusted for confounders, sampling weight, clustering and stratification were used to examine the association between socioeconomic, demographic, health service and community level factors with early initiation of breastfeeding and EBF from 2000 to 2016. The prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding increased from 48.8% in 2000 to 75.7% in 2016 in Ethiopia. Improvement in EBF prevalence was not statistically significant (from 54.5% in 2000 to 59.9% in 2016). Over the study period, informal maternal employment (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0.75; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.68, 0.83), frequent antenatal care visits (aOR 0.74; 95% CI 0.65, 0.85), and cesarean birthing (aOR 0.22; 95% CI 0.17, 0.30) were associated with delayed initiation of breastfeeding. Birthing in the health facility (aOR 1.35; 95% CI 1.05, 1.75) and residing in the metropolis region (aOR 1.95; 95% CI 1.65, 2.32) were associated with timely initiation of breastfeeding.

However, comprehensive strategies may not represent the most efficient or effective approach to reducing disease burden at the population level. Rather, they may act to spread finite resources less intensively over a greater number of programs and initiatives, diluting the potential impact of the investment. While analytic tools are available that use research evidence to help identify and prioritise disease risk factors for public health action, they are inadequate to support more targeted and effective policy responses for complex public health problems. This paper discusses the limitations of analytic tools that are commonly used to support evidence-informed policy decisions for complex problems. It proposes an alternative policy analysis tool which can integrate diverse evidence sources and provide a platform for virtual testing of policy alternatives in order to design solutions that are efficient, effective, and equitable. The case of suicide prevention in Australia is presented to demonstrate the limitations of current tools to adequately inform prevention policy and discusses the utility of the new policy analysis tool. In contrast to popular belief, a systems approach takes a step beyond comprehensive thinking and seeks to identify where best to target public health action and resources for optimal impact. It is concerned primarily with what can be reasonably left out of strategies \u2026"

These fuels produce high levels of indoor air pollution. This study aimed to determine whether Nigerian children residing in households using solid fuels at <5 years of age were at higher risk of death. The 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data were analysed in Cox regression analyses to examine the effects of solid fuel use on deaths of children aged 0\u201328 days (neonatal), 1\u201311 months (post-neonatal), and 12\u201359 months (child). The results indicated that approximately 0.8% of neonatal deaths, 42.9% of post-neonatal deaths, and 36.3% of child deaths could be attributed to use of solid fuels. The multivariable analyses found that use of solid fuel was associated with post-neonatal mortality (hazard ratio [HR] =1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42\u20132.58) and child mortality (HR\u2009=\u20091.63, CI: 1.09\u20132.42), but was not associated with neonatal mortality (HR\u2009=\u20091.01, CI: 0.73\u20131.26). Living in rural areas and poor households were associated with an increased risk of death during the three mortality periods. Living in a rural area and poor households were strongly associated with an increased risk of a child\u2009>\u20091 to\u2009<\u200960 months dying due to use of solid fuels. The health effects of household use of solid fuels are a major public health threat that requires increased research and policy development efforts. Research should focus on populations in rural areas and low socioeconomic households so that child survival in Nigeria can be improved."

Using data from the most recent Global Burden of Disease, Injury, and Risk Factor Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we aimed to describe the burden of disease attributable to depressive disorders in terms of prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in South Asia countries (namely India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan). GBD 2016 used epidemiological data on depressive disorders (major depression and dysthymia) from South Asia and a Bayesian meta-regression tool (DisMod-MR 2.1) to model prevalence and DALYs of depressive disorders by age, sex, country and year. DALYs were calculated from the years lived with disability (YLDs), derived from the prevalence of depressive disorders and disability weights, obtained from a community and internet-based surveys. The analyses adjusted for comorbidity, data sources and multiple modelling, and estimates were presented with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). In 2016, the age-standardised prevalence of depressive disorders in South Asia was 3.9% (95% UI: 3.6\u20134.2%), 4.4% (95% UI: 4.4\u20134.8%) in Bangladesh, 3.9% (95% UI: 3.6\u20134.2%) in India, 3.0% (95% UI: 2.8\u20133.3%) in Pakistan, 4.0% (95% UI: 3.7\u20134.3%) in Nepal and 3.7% (95% UI: 3.4\u20134.1%) in Bhutan. In South Asia, depressive disorders accounted for 9.8 million DALYs (95% UI: 6.8\u201313.2 million) or 577.8 (95% UI: 399.9\u2013778.9) per 100,000 population in 2016. Of these, major depressive disorders (MDD) accounted for 7.8 million DALYs (95% UI: 5.3\u201310.5 million). India generated the largest numbers of DALYs due to depressive disorders \u2026"

This study investigates for the first time the association between HAP from cooking fuel and under-five mortality using the 2013 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) data. Multi-level logistic regression models were used to examine the association between HAP and under-five mortality in a total of 11,507 living children across four age-groups (neonatal aged 0\u201328 days, post-neonatal aged 1\u201311 months, child aged 12\u201359 months and under-five aged 0\u201359 months). Use of cooking fuel was weakly associated with total under-five mortality (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.92\u20131.64, P = 0.170), with stronger associations evident for sub-group analyses of children aged 12\u201359 months (OR = 1.98, 95%CI = 0.75\u20135.25, P = 0.169). Strong associations between use of cooking fuel and mortality were evident (ORs >5) in those aged 12\u201359 months for households without a separate kitchen using polluting fuels, and in children whose mother never breastfed. The results of this study suggest that HAP from cooking fuel is associated with a modest increase in the risk of death among children under five years of age in Pakistan, but particularly in those aged 12\u201359 months, and those living in poorer socioeconomic conditions. To reduce exposure to cooking fuel which is a preventable determinant of under-five mortality in Pakistan, the challenge remains to promote behavioural interventions such as breastfeeding in infancy period, keeping young children away from the \u2026"

The association between optimal infant feeding practices and diarrhoea has been reported elsewhere, but the evidence has been limited to promote and advocate for strategic interventions in Tanzania. This study examined the association between infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and diarrhoea in Tanzanian children under 24 months. The study used the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey data to estimate the prevalence of diarrhoea stratified by IYCF practices. Using multivariable logistic regression modelling that adjusted for confounding factors and cluster variability, the association between IYCF practices and diarrhoea among Tanzanian children was investigated. Diarrhoea prevalence was lower in infants aged 0\u20135 months whose mothers engaged in exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and predominant breastfeeding (PBF) compared to those who were not exclusively and predominantly breastfed. Infants aged 6\u20138 months who were introduced to complementary foods had a higher prevalence of diarrhoea compared to those who received no complementary foods, that is, infants who were exclusively breastfed at 6\u20138 months. Infants who were exclusively and predominantly breastfed were less likely to experience diarrhoea compared to those who were not exclusively and predominantly breastfed [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16\u20130.59, P\u2009<\u20090.001 for EBF and AOR\u2009=\u20090.30, 95% CI 0.10\u20130.89, P\u2009=\u20090.031 for PBF].

                "abstract": "Suicide in young adults remains an important public health issue in Australia. The attributable risks associated with broader socioeconomic factors, compared to more proximal psychiatric disorders, have not been considered previously in individual-level studies of young adults. This study compared the relative contributions of psychiatric disorder and socio-economic disadvantage associated with suicide in terms of relative and attributable risk in young adults. A population-based case\u2013control study of young adults (18\u201334 years) compared cases of suicide (n\u2009=\u200984) with randomly selected controls (n\u2009=\u2009250) from population catchments in New South Wales (Australia), with exposure information collected from key informant interviews (for both cases and controls). The relative and attributable risk of suicide associated with ICD-10 defined substance use, affective, and anxiety disorder was compared with educational achievement and household income, adjusting for key confounders. Prevalence of exposures from the control group was used to estimate population attributable fractions (PAF). Strong associations were evident between mental disorders and suicide for both males and females (ORs 3.1 to 18.7). The strongest association was for anxiety disorders (both males and females), followed by affective disorders and substance use disorders. Associations for socio-economic status were smaller in magnitude than for mental disorders for both males and females (ORs 1.1 to 4.8 for lower compared to high SES groups). The combined PAF% for all mental disorders (48% for males and 52% for females) was similar in magnitude to socio-economic \u2026"

This study investigates the association between HAP from cooking fuel and under-five mortality using India\u2019s National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) datasets over the period 1992\u20132006 (total of 166,382 children), and the extent to which the association differed by environmental and behavioral factors affecting level of exposure. The association between HAP and under-five mortality of three age-groups (neonatal age between 0\u201328 days, post-neonatal age between 1\u201311 months and children aged between 12\u201359 months) was examined using multi-level logistic regression models. HAP was associated with mortality among children aged under-five (OR\u2009=\u20091.30, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.18-1.43, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and was more strongly associated in sub-group analyses of post-neonatal mortality (OR\u2009=\u20091.42, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.19-1.71, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and child mortality (OR\u2009=\u20091.42, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.05-1.91, P\u2009=\u20090.021) than neonatal mortality (OR\u2009=\u20091.23, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.09-1.39, P\u2009=\u20090.001). The association was stronger for households in rural areas and for households without a separate kitchen using polluting fuel, and in women who had never breastfed for all age-groups. Use of cooking fuel in the household is associated with increased risk of mortality in children aged under-five years. Factors relating to access to clean fuels, improvements in infrastructure and household design and behavioral factors are discussed, and can result in further declines in under-five \u2026"

This paper examined trends and predictors of prelacteal feeding practices in Nigeria. A sample of 6416 infants aged 0\u20136 months from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data for the period (2003\u20132013) was used. Trends and multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to determine the predictors. The trends of prelacteal feeding rates fluctuated between 55% and 66% over the study period and were significantly lower among mothers with secondary or higher levels of education (13.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54\u201325.9, p-value = 0.041), delivered at the health facility (13.7%, CI: 1.39\u201325.9, p-value = 0.029), from more affluent households (18.7%, CI: 1.53\u201335.9, p-value = 0.033), and lived in urban areas (26.9%, CI: 18.3\u201335.5, p-value < 0.001). Multivariable analyses revealed that mothers with no schooling, younger mothers (aged 15\u201324 years), mothers who delivered at home, and delivered by caesarean section were more likely to introduce prelacteal feeds. Many mothers still engage in prelacteal feeding practices in Nigeria, with prelacteal feeding more prevalent in young mothers, mothers with no schooling, and mothers who delivered at home. Interventions involving community health volunteers are needed to improve feeding practices in Nigeria."

Furthermore, search activity in relation to specific methods of suicide have been shown to mirror high profile media reporting of an unusual method of suicide in the UK and Japan [3]. Seasonal variations in the volume of Internet searches relating to depression, mirroring seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of depression, have also been noted [4]. There is perhaps the potential to use trends in Internet searching relating to suicide as a kind of barometer of actual suicidal ideation and behaviour in a community [3], in the same way as it has been suggested it may be useful in identifying the onset of epidemics of infectious disease [5].

Results The suicide rate (per 100 000) in China decreased from 14.7 to 9.1, 2006\u20132012. Rates of suicide were higher in males than females and increased substantially with age.

This study investigates the association between HAP from cooking fuel and under-five mortality using Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) datasets over the period 2004\u20132011 (n = 18,308 children), and the extent to which this association differed by environmental and behavioral factors affecting level of exposure. The association between HAP and neonatal (age between 0\u201328 days), infant (age between 0 and 11 months) and under\u2013five (age between 0 and 59 months) mortality was examined using multilevel logistic regression models. HAP was not strongly associated with overall neonatal (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.01\u20132.22, p = 0.043), infant (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 0.91\u20131.77, p = 0.157) or under-five mortality (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.83\u20131.55, p = 0.422) in the context of overall decreasing trends in under-five mortality. The association was stronger for households with an indoor kitchen using polluting fuels, and in women who had never breastfed. Reductions in exposure to pollution from cooking fuel, given it is a ubiquitous and modifiable risk factor, can result in further declines in under-five mortality with household design and behavioural interventions."

Cetirizine\u2019s large size, lipophobic nature, and greater affinity for peripheral H1 receptors are believed to reduce CNS penetration and central side effects (2). However, one positron emission tomography study of cetirizine revealed approximately 30% H1 receptor binding in the cerebral cortex (1, 2). Cetirizine has negligible anticholinergic activity (6). We speculate that as a piperazine derivative, cetirizine blocked the striatal D2 receptors and resulted in an acute dystonic reaction in our patient. In addition, we also speculate that our patient\u2019s 3-month cetirizine use resulted in D2 receptor hypersensitivity similar to that observed in long-term antipsychotic use, with subsequent involuntary movements after its discontinuation.

Method A cross-sectional study of three datasets from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys for the years 2004, 2007 and 2011 were pooled and used for the analyses. A total weighted sample of 16,721 maternal responses (5,364 for 2004; 4,872 for 2007 and 6,485 for 2011) was used.

METHODS: Standard life-table methods using age-specific all-cause mortality and population data from 1981 to 2003 were used to calculate life expectancy at birth (e0) for the total Australian population (including migrants) and for people born in Australia (excluding migrants). Mean differences in life expectancy for each sex were compared using paired t-tests. Rankings of life expectancy among OECD countries were reassessed, and rank changes measured using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. FINDINGS: Life expectancy of males and females was significantly lower in the Australian-born group than in the total Australian population. During 1981 to 2003, there was a mean difference in life expectancy of 0.41 years (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.37-0.44; t17 = 27.0; P < 0.0001) in males and 0.29 years (95% CI: 0.26-0.31; t17 = 27.6; P < 0.0001) in females between the Australian-born and the total population. After excluding migrant groups, Australia no longer ranked among the top five OECD countries with the highest life expectancy in the two most recent years examined. CONCLUSION: While Australia has one of the highest life expectancies in the industrialized world, this is partly attributable to immigration of populations with low rates of mortality. This effect needs to be considered in international comparative assessments of mortality levels."

This study assessed whether MVs and unemployment were associated with suicide in eight Australian capital cities. Data on suicide, population and unemployment rate (UER) between 1985 and 2005 were from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. MVs was provided by Australian Bureau of Meteorology. A generalized linear regression model with Poisson link was applied to explore the association of suicide with MVs and UER. Temperature difference (\u0394T, the difference in mean temperature between current month and previous one month) was positively associated with suicide in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Hobart. There was also a significant and positive association between UER and suicide in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. MVs had more significant associations with violent suicide than that of non-violent suicide. There were no consistent associations between other MVs and suicide. A significant interaction between \u0394T and UER on suicide was found in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, such that increased temperature amplified the magnitude of the association between UER and suicide. \u0394T and UER appeared to jointly influence the occurrence of suicide in Australian capital cities. This finding may have implications for developing effective suicide prevention strategies."

Data sources for the analyses were the latest Demographic and Health Survey datasets of the 4 countries, namely Ghana (GDHS, 2008), Liberia (LDHS, 2007), Nigeria (NDHS, 2013) and Sierra Leone (SLDHS, 2008). Multiple logistic regression methods were used to analyze the factors associated with early introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods among infants aged 3\u20135 months, using individual-, household- and community-level determinants. The sample consisted of 2447 infants aged 3\u20135 months from four Anglophone West African countries: 166 in Ghana, 263 in Liberia, 1658 in Nigeria and 360 in Sierra Leone. Multivariable analyses revealed the individual factors associated with early introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods in these countries. These included increased infant\u2019s age, diarrhea, acute respiratory infection and newborns perceived to be small by their mothers. Other predictors of early introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods were: mothers with no schooling, young mothers and fathers who worked in an agricultural industry. Public health interventions to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices by discouraging early introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods are needed in all 4 countries, targeting especially mothers at risk of introducing solid foods to their infants early."

Improving the burden of TB among HIV-negative people would require comprehensive and up-to-date data to inform targeted policy actions in Nigeria. The study aimed to describe the incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and risk factors of tuberculosis in Nigeria between 1990 and 2016. This study used the most recent data from the global burden of disease study 2016. TB deaths were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model, while TB incidence, prevalence and DALYs, as well as years of life lost and years of life lived with disability were calculated in the DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. Using a comparative risk assessment approach, TB burden attributable to risk factors was estimated in a spatial-temporal Gaussian Process Regression tool. In 2016, the prevalence of TB among HIV-negative people was 27% (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 23\u201331%) in Nigeria. TB incidence rate (new and relapse cases) was 158 per 100,000 people (95% UI; 128-193), while the total number of TB mortality was 39,933 deaths (95% UI; 30,488-55,039) in 2016. Between 2000 and 2016, the age-standardised prevalence and incidence rates of TB-HIV negative decreased by 20.0 and 87.6%, respectively. The age-standardised mortality rate also dropped by 191.6% over the same period. DALYs due to TB among HIV-negative Nigerians was high but varied across the age groups.

                "abstract": "Dynamic simulation modelling is increasingly being recognised as a valuable decision-support tool to help guide investments and actions to address complex public health issues such as suicide. In particular, participatory system dynamics (SD) modelling provides a useful tool for asking high-level'what if'questions, and testing the likely impacts of different combinations of policies and interventions at an aggregate level before they are implemented in the real world. We developed an SD model for suicide prevention in Australia, and investigated the hypothesised impacts over the next 10 years (2015-2025) of a combination of current intervention strategies proposed for population interventions in Australia: 1) general practitioner (GP) training, 2) coordinated aftercare in those who have attempted suicide, 3) school-based mental health literacy programs, 4) brief-contact interventions in hospital settings, and 5) psychosocial treatment approaches. Findings suggest that the largest reductions in suicide were associated with GP training (6%) and coordinated aftercare approaches (4%), with total reductions of 12% for all interventions combined. This paper highlights the value of dynamic modelling methods for managing complexity and uncertainty, and demonstrates their potential use as a decision-support tool for policy makers and program planners for community suicide prevention actions."

Percentage point changes in complementary feeding indicators were estimated to examine the trends over the EDHS years.

UNAIDS/WHO/CDC recommends provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) for HIV in settings with high HIV prevalence. We aimed to assess the acceptability and logistical feasibility of the PITC strategy among adolescents and adults in a secondary health care centre in Idekpa Benue state, Nigeria. All patients (aged\u2009\u2265\u200913 years) who visited the out-patient department and antenatal care unit of General Hospital Idekpa, Benue state, Nigeria were offered PITC for HIV. The intervention was implemented by trained health professionals for the period spanning (June to December 2010). Among the 212 patients who were offered PITC for HIV, 199 (94%) accepted HIV testing, 10 patients (4.7%) opted out and 3 patients (1.4%) were undecided. Of the 199 participants who were tested for HIV, 9% were HIV seropositive. The PITC strategy was highly acceptable and feasible, and increased the number of patients who tested for HIV by 5% compared to voluntary counselling and testing. Findings from this assessment were consistent with those from other sub-Saharan African countries (such as Uganda and South Africa). PITC for HIV was highly acceptable and logistically feasible, and resulted in an increased rate of HIV testing among patients. Public health initiatives (such as the PITC strategy) that facilitate early detection of HIV and referral for early treatment should be encouraged for broader HIV control and prevention in Nigerian communities."

For mental disorders, the highest PAR% for attempted suicide was for anxiety disorders (males 28%; females 36%). For SES, the highest PAR% for attempted suicide in males was for occupation (males 31%; females 16%) and education level (males 19%; females 8%), following adjustment for age and mental disorders. The study results suggest that one third of suicide attempts in both males and females are attributable to anxiety disorders, the same proportion attributable to low educational or occupational status."

Age and gender stratified annual diabetes mortality counts for 161 counties were extracted from the China Mortality Surveillance System and interrogated using multilevel negative binomial regression. Random slopes were used to investigate spatiotemporal variation and the proportion of variance explained was used to assess the relative importance of geographical region, urbanization, mean temperature, local diabetes prevalence, behavioral risk factors and relevant biomarkers. Diabetes mortality tended to reduce between 2006 and 2012, though there appeared to be an increase in diabetes mortality in urban (age standardized rate (ASR) 2006\u20132012: 10.5\u201313.6) and rural (ASR 10.8\u201313.0) areas in the Southwest region. A Median Rate Ratio of 1.47, slope variance of 0.006 (SE 0.001) and covariance of 0.268 (SE 0.007) indicated spatiotemporal variation. Fully adjusted models accounted for 37 % of this geographical variation, with diabetes mortality higher in the Northwest (RR 2.55, 95 % CI 1.74, 3.73) and Northeast (RR 2.68, 95 % CI 1.70, 4.21) compared with the South. Diabetes mortality was higher in urbanized areas (RR tertile 3 versus tertile 1 (\u2018RRt3vs1\u2019) 1.39, 95 % CI 1.17, 1.66), with higher mean body mass index (RRt3vs1 1.46, 95 % CI 1.18, 1.80) and with higher average temperatures (RR 1.05 95 % CI 1.03, 1.08).

The incidence trend for women aged 50 to 69 years showed that the steepest rise was associated with increased participation in population-based mammography screening, which was implemented from 1988 and achieved state-wide coverage in 1995.

This study investigated the determinants of EBF cessation in the early postnatal period among CALD Australian mothers in Sydney, Australia. The study used linked maternal and child health data from two local health districts in Australia (N = 25,407). Prevalence of maternal breastfeeding intention, skin-to-skin contact, EBF at birth, discharge, and the early postnatal period (1\u20134 weeks postnatal), were estimated. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate determinants of EBF cessation in the early postnatal period. Most CALD Australian mothers had the intention to breastfeed (94.7%). Skin-to-skin contact (81.0%), EBF at delivery (91.0%), and at discharge (93.0%) were high. EBF remained high in the early postnatal period (91.4%). A lack of prenatal breastfeeding intention was the strongest determinant of EBF cessation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 23.76, 95% CI: 18.63\u201330.30, for mothers with no prenatal breastfeeding intention and aOR = 6.15, 95% CI: 4.74\u20137.98, for those undecided). Other significant determinants of EBF cessation included a lack of partner support, antenatal and postnatal depression, intimate partner violence, low socioeconomic status, caesarean birth, and young maternal age (<20 years). Efforts to improve breastfeeding among women of CALD backgrounds in Australia should focus on women with vulnerabilities to maximise the benefits of EBF."

However, the prevalence of children fed in accordance with IYCF recommendations in Nigeria remains low. This paper presents time trends in IYCF practices in Nigeria for the period (1999\u20132013), and considers trends in the context of key national policy responses and initiatives. Prevalence and percentage change (including 95% confidence intervals) of IYCF indicators were investigated over the period 1999\u20132013 based on a total of 88,152 maternal responses from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Surveys, (n\u2009=\u20098,199 in 1999; n\u2009=\u20097,620 in 2003; n\u2009=\u200933,385 in 2008 and n\u2009=\u200938,948 in 2013).

From 2003 to 2013, minimum meal frequency increased significantly by 13.8% (95% CI: 9.9, 17.8; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but minimum dietary diversity and minimum acceptable decreased significantly by 9.7% (95% CI: \u22129.2, \u22126.3; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 3.5% (95% CI: \u22125.7, \u22121.3; p\u2009=\u20090.002), respectively.

Methods Using two cohorts from a national representative longitudinal study, the Longitudinal Study of Australian Youth (N = 20991), latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis were conducted to examine transition patterns among subjective well-being profiles for youth from age 17 to 25. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate whether key socio-demographic variables were associated with transition stability.   Results We identified: (1) three subjective well-being profiles: Low (30%), Moderate (50%), and High (20%); and (2) three major transition patterns among these subjective well-being profiles: stable, partially-stable, and unstable. The majority of youth had stable transition patterns during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. A large percentage of youth (52%) started low in subjective well-being profile and remained in the low subjective-wellbeing profile. Our examination also revealed gender was the most pronounced indicator for transition stability during this time period, with males more likely to have unstable transition patterns than females.   Conclusions Results suggest that different subjective well-being status and transition patterns can be identified in the post-high school transition to adulthood, including unstable transitions. By targeting those groups more vulnerable to transition, mental health promotion and interventions may be delivered more effectively."

Since brief contact interventions (BCIs) may reduce the risk of DSH repetition, we aim to evaluate whether a SMS (Short Message Service) text message Intervention plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone will reduce hospital DSH re-presentation rates in Western Sydney public hospitals in Australia. Our study is a 24-month randomized controlled trial (RCT). Adult patients who present with DSH to hospital emergency, psychiatric, and mental health triage and assessment departments will be randomly assigned to an Intervention condition plus TAU receiving nine SMS text messages at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12-months post-discharge. Each message will contain telephone numbers for two mental health crises support tele-services. Primary outcomes will be the difference in the number of DSH re-presentations, and the time to first re-presentation, within 12-months of discharge. This study protocol describes the design and implementation of an RCT using SMS text messages, which aim to reduce hospital re-presentation rates for DSH. Positive study findings would support the translation of an SMS-aftercare protocol into mental health services at minimal expense.

Residents and other interest groups have voiced concerns about the potential environmental and health impacts related to CSG. This paper compares objective health outcomes from three study areas in Queensland, Australia to examine potential environmentally-related health impacts. Three study areas were selected in an ecologic study design: a CSG area, a coal mining area, and a rural/agricultural area. Admitted patient data, as well as population data and additional factors, were obtained for each calendar year from 1995 through 2011 to calculate all-age hospitalization rates and age-standardized rates in each of these areas. The three areas were compared using negative binomial regression analyses (unadjusted and adjusted models) to examine increases over time of hospitalization rates grouped by primary diagnosis (19 ICD chapters), with rate ratios serving to compare the within-area regression slopes between the areas. The CSG area did not have significant increases in all-cause hospitalization rates over time for all-ages compared to the coal and rural study areas in adjusted models (RR: 1.02, 95 % CI: 1.00\u20131.04 as compared to the coal mining area; RR: 1.01, 95 % CI: 0.99\u20131.04 as compared to the rural area). While the CSG area did not show significant increases in specific hospitalization rates compared to both the coal mining and rural areas for any ICD chapters in the adjusted models, the CSG area showed increases in hospitalization rates compared only to the rural area for \u2026"

The study used multiple logistic regression methods to analyse the factors associated with early introduction of complementary feeding using individual-, household- and community-level determinants. The sample was composed of 4158 infants aged between three and five months with: 671 from Benin, 811 from Burkina Faso, 362 from Cote d\u2019Ivoire, 398 from Guinea, 519 from Mali, 767 from Niger and 630 from Senegal. Multiple analyses indicated that in three of the seven countries (Benin, Guinea and Senegal), infants who suffered illnesses, such as diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection, were significantly more likely to be introduced to formula and/or solid, semi-solid or soft foods between the age of three and five months. Other significant factors included infants who: were born in second to fourth position (Benin), whose mothers did not attend any antenatal clinics (Burkina Faso and Niger), were male (Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal), lived in an urban areas (Senegal), or were delivered by traditional birth attendants (Guinea, Niger and Senegal).

The present study aimed to report on diarrhoea deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) among children aged under five years attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding practices in Nigeria. This study used data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2016, which estimated mortality from diarrhoea in the Cause of Death Ensemble model. Suboptimal breastfeeding was assessed as a combination of non-exclusive breastfeeding and discontinued breastfeeding. The comparative risk assessment approach was used to estimate the attributable burden of diarrhoea deaths and DALYs due to suboptimal breastfeeding practices in the spatial-temporal Gaussian Process Regression tool. In 2016, suboptimal breastfeeding practices accounted for an estimated 56.5% (95% uncertainty intervals [UI]: 47.5, 68.3) of diarrhoea deaths in the late neonatal period, 39.0% (31.0, 46.3) in post-neonatal period, 39.0% (31.3, 46.20) in infancy period and 22.8% (16.9, 29.9) in children aged under five years in Nigeria. In the same year, 22,371 (14,259, 32,746) total diarrhoea deaths in children under five years could be attributed to suboptimal breastfeeding practices. DALYs from diarrhoea attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding practices was 1.9 million (1.2, 2.8 million) among children under five years in 2016. Between 1990 and 2016, the proportion of children who died from diarrhoea due to suboptimal breastfeeding did not change substantially across all age groups in Nigeria.

Suicide rates in the period after the peak of the epidemic in this age group (1998) were re-calculated based on published estimates of under-enumeration of suicide data, and misclassification of likely suicide cases to other unintentional and undetermined external causes. Two misclassification scenarios were used to revise young male suicide rates from 1998: previously reported estimates of 9% under-enumeration due to misclassification of unintentional causes of death, and 17% under-enumeration due to misclassification of open cases in addition to unintentional causes of death.

Method: This study acquired unpublished suicide data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2014 and 2015 including caste, tribal, and religious associations of suicide cases. National and state-specific suicide rates (2014\u20132015) were then calculated for Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and other religious groups and for scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), and other backward classes (OBC). Results: The findings show higher suicide rates among Christian and other religious groups compared with Hindus and higher suicide rates among general populations compared with SC, ST \u2026"

Lung cancer mortality counts for people aged over 40 years were extracted from the China Mortality Surveillance System for 161 disease surveillance points. Negative binomial regression was used to investigate potential spatiotemporal variation and correlations with age, gender, urbanization, and region. Lung cancer mortality increased in China over the study period from 78.77 to 85.63 (1/100,000), with higher mortality rates evident in men compared to women. Median rate ratios (MRRs) indicated important geographical variation in lung cancer mortality between provinces (MRR = 1.622) and counties/districts (MRR = 1.447). On average, lung cancer mortality increased over time and was positively associated with county-level urbanization (relative risk (RR) = 1.15). Lung cancer mortality seemed to decrease in urban and increase in rural areas. Compared to the northwest, mortality was higher in the north (RR = 1.98), east (RR = 1.87), central (RR = 1.87), and northeast (RR = 2.44). Regional differences and county-level urbanization accounted for 49.4% and 8.7% of provincial and county variation, respectively. Reductions in lung cancer mortality in urban areas may reflect improvements in access to preventive healthcare and treatment services. Rising mortality in rural areas may reflect a clustering of risk factors associated with rapid urbanization."

Understanding the associations between infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and ARI and diarrhoea can inform IYCF policy interventions and advocacy in Ethiopia. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between IYCF practices and ARI and diarrhoea in Ethiopian children.   Methods This study used the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data for the years 2000 (n = 3680), 2005 (n = 3528), 2011 (n = 4037), and 2016 (n = 3861). The association between IYCF practices and (i) ARI and (ii) diarrhoea were investigated using propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression models. The IYCF practices include early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), predominant breastfeeding, introduction of complementary foods, continued breastfeeding at two years and bottle feeding.   Results Infants and young children who were breastfed within 1-hour of birth and those who were exclusively breastfed had a lower prevalence of ARI. Infants who were exclusively and predominantly breastfed had a lower prevalence of diarrhoea. Early initiation of breastfeeding (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72, 0.92) and EBF (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.83) were associated with lower risk of ARI. Bottle-fed children had higher odds of ARI (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.68). Early initiation of breastfeeding and EBF were associated with lower odds of diarrhoea (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.94 for Early initiation of breastfeeding and OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.65 for EBF \u2026"

In those settings, obesogenic factors (attributes that promote excessive body weight gain) are increasing in the context of an existing high burden of undernutrition. The present study investigated factors associated with underweight, overweight, and obesity among reproductive age women in Tanzania.   Methods This study used 2015\u201316 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey data (n = 11735). To account for the hierarchical nature of the data (i.e., reproductive age women nested within clusters), multilevel multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between individual-level (socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural) and community-level factors with underweight, overweight, and obesity.   Results Reproductive age women who were informally employed (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.96), those who were currently married (RRR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.82) and those who used contraceptives (RRR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.90) were less likely to be underweight. Reproductive age women who attained secondary or higher education (RRR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.96), those who resided in wealthier households (RRR = 2.31; 95% CI: 1.78, 3.03) and those who watched the television (RRR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.50) were more likely to be overweight.

                "abstract": "There has been ongoing debate regarding the impact of reductions in psychiatric beds on suicide rates, and the potential effect of reallocation of acute hospital funding to community-based mental health programs and services. Computer simulation offers significant value in advancing such debate by providing a robust platform for exploring strategic resource allocation scenarios before they are implemented in the real world. We report an application that demonstrates a threshold effect of cuts to psychiatric beds on suicide rates and the role of context specific variations in population, behavioral, and service use dynamics in determining where that threshold lies. Findings have important implications for regional decision-making regarding resource allocation for suicide prevention."

To evaluate and compare childhood mortality attributable to HAP in four South Asian countries. A series of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) datasets for Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan were used for analysis. Estimates of relative risk and exposure prevalence relating to use of cooking fuel and under-five mortality were used to calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs) for each country. Potential impact fractions (PIFs) were also calculated assessing theoretical scenarios based on published interventions aiming to reduce exposure prevalence. There are an increased risk of under-five mortality in those exposed to cooking fuel compared to those not exposed in the four South Asian countries (OR\u2009=\u20091.30, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.07\u20131.57, P\u2009=\u20090.007). Combined PAF estimates for South Asia found that 66% (95% CI: 43.1\u201381.5%) of the 13,290 estimated cases of under-five mortality was attributable to HAP. Joint PIF estimates (assuming achievable reductions in HAP reported in intervention studies conducted in South Asia) indicates 47% of neonatal and 43% of under-five mortality cases associated with HAP could be avoidable in the four South Asian countries studied. Elimination of exposure to use of cooking fuel in the household targeting valuable intervention strategies (such as cooking in separate kitchen, improved cook stoves) could reduce substantially under-five mortality in South Asian countries."

These counts were linked to annually adjusted denominator populations. Multilevel negative binomial regression with random intercepts and slopes were used to investigate spatiotemporal variation in COPD mortality adjusting for age, gender and area-level risk factors. COPD mortality rate decreased markedly from 105.1 to 73.7 per 100,000 during 2006 to 2012 and varied over two-fold between DSPs across China. Mortality rates were higher in the west compared \u2026"

This study reviews modifiable risk factors associated with fatal and nonfatal injury from low-speed vehicle runover (LSVRO) incidents involving children aged 0\u201315 years. Data Sources. Electronic searches for child pedestrian and driveway injuries from the peer-reviewed literature and transport-related websites from 1955 to 2012. Study Selection. 41 studies met the study inclusion criteria. Data Extraction. A systematic narrative summary was conducted that included study design, methodology, risk factors, and other study variables. Results. The most commonly reported risk factors for LSVRO incidents included age under 5 years, male gender, and reversing vehicles. The majority of reported incidents involved residential driveways, but several studies identified other traffic and nontraffic locations. Low socioeconomic status and rental accommodation were also associated with LSVRO injury. Vehicles were most commonly driven by a family member, predominantly a parent. Conclusion. There are a number of modifiable vehicular, environmental, and behavioural factors associated with LSVRO injuries in young children that have been identified in the literature to date. Strategies relating to vehicle design (devices for increased rearward visibility and crash avoidance systems), housing design (physical separation of driveway and play areas), and behaviour (driver behaviour, supervision of young children) are discussed."

A literature review was conducted of (HIA) methods and health studies of CSG development areas in Queensland. Forty-eight interviews were conducted in the Darling Downs CSG region in Queensland. One Queensland Health report was identified but failed to meet HIA international best practice because 7 of 9 key steps were omitted. Interview participants reported poor consultation by government and industry within affected communities. Lack of and poor quality health data was found to exacerbate community tensions. We recommend application of HIAs, epidemiological studies, consultation with communities and consideration of social risks of poor quality health studies."

Despite concerns, health data have not been examined alongside CSG development. This study examined hospitalisation rates as a function of CSG development activity in Queensland, during the period 1995\u20132011. Admissions data were examined with CSG well numbers, which served as a proxy for CSG development activity. Time series models were used to assess changes in hospitalisation rates for periods of \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, \u201chigh\u201d, and \u201cintense\u201d activity compared to a period of \u201cvery low\u201d activity, adjusting for covariates. \u201cAll-cause\u201d hospitalisation rates increased monotonically with increasing gas well development activity in females (324.0 to 390.3 per 1000 persons) and males (294.2 to 335.4 per 1000 persons). Hospitalisation rates for \u201cBlood/immune\u201d conditions generally increased for both sexes. Female and male hospitalisation rates for \u201cCirculatory\u201d conditions decreased with increasing CSG activity. Hospitalisation rates were generally low for reproductive and birth outcomes; no clear associations were observed. This study showed some outcomes were associated with increasing CSG development activity. However, as a condition of data access, the population and outcomes were aggregated to a broad geographic study area rather than using higher geographic resolution data. Higher resolution data, as well as other data sources, should be explored. Further research should be conducted with an expanded time period to determine if these trends continue as the industry grows."

TAU is a configurable, open-source computer simulation of a university using a contact network based on publicly available information about university classes, residences, and activities. This study evaluates health outcomes for an array of interventions and testing protocols in an artificial university of 6,500 students, faculty, and staff. Findings suggest that physical distancing and centralized contact tracing are most effective at reducing infections, but there is a tipping point for compliance below which physical distancing is less effective. If student compliance is anything short of high, it helps to have separate buildings for quarantining infected students, thereby gracefully increasing compliance. Hybrid in-person and online classes and closing fitness centers do not significantly change cumulative infections but do significantly decrease the number of the infected at any given time, indicating strategies for \u201cflattening the curve\u201d to protect limited resources. Supplementing physical distancing with centralized contact tracing decreases infected individuals by an additional 14%; boosting frequency of testing for student-facing staff yields a further 7% decrease. A trade-off exists between increasing the sheer number of infection tests and targeting testing for key nodes in the contact network (i.e., student-facing staff). There are significant advantages to getting and acting on test results quickly. The costs and benefits to universities of these findings are discussed. Artificial universities can be an important decision support tool for \u2026"

The present study investigated psychosocial and obstetric factors associated with perinatal distress and depressive symptoms among culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) Australian women in Sydney, New South Wales. The study used retrospectively linked maternal and child health data from two Local Health Districts in Australia (N = 25,407). Perinatal distress was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, scores of 10\u201312) and depressive symptoms, with EPDS scores of 13 or more. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between psychosocial and obstetric factors with perinatal distress and depressive symptoms. The prevalence of perinatal distress and depressive symptoms among CALD Australian women was 10.1% for antenatal distress; 7.3% for antenatal depressive symptoms; 6.2% for postnatal distress and 3.7% for postnatal depressive symptoms. Antenatal distress and depressive symptoms were associated with a lack of partner support, intimate partner violence, maternal history of childhood abuse and being known to child protection services. Antenatal distress and depressive symptoms were strongly associated with postnatal distress and depressive symptoms. Higher socioeconomic status had a protective effect on antenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms. Our study suggests that current perinatal mental health screening and referral for clinical assessment is essential, and also supports a re-examination of perinatal mental health policy to ensure \u2026"

Trends in mortality and the cause structure of deaths among young adult Australian males over 1979\u20132011 are investigated, with a focus on suicide and drug overdose. Mortality data by age for the period 1979 to 2011 and Australian population figures were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Cause of death was investigated using relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and mortality by cause was examined graphically over time according to various ICD aggregations. Mortality trends were contextualised in relation to labour market changes occurring in Australia from the 1980s to early 2000s. Although motor vehicle accident (MVA) mortality declined by half between 1980 and 1998 in males, this did not translate into a reduction in total young male mortality because of simultaneous increases in suicide, and drug-related deaths classified as either poisoning (external cause) or drug dependence (mental disorders). When both suicide and drug-related deaths declined concurrently after 1998, total 20\u201334 year male mortality declined by almost half (46%) over 1998\u20132011. Declines in external cause mortality accounted for 63% of the total mortality decline in 20\u201334 year males over 1998\u20132011. The close temporal coincidence (statistically significant) of increases and declines in suicide and drug-related deaths over a decade suggests related causality.

Few studies have properly accounted for geographic variation, however, which may influence prior results. Using large data with biomarkers in China, we show body mass index (BMI) to be positively correlated with higher person-level education if estimated using ordinary least squares. In stark contrast, fitting the same data within a multilevel model gives the complete opposite result. We go on to show that the relationship between BMI and person-level education in China is dependent upon geography, underlining why multilevel modelling is crucial for revealing these types of people-place contingencies."

The World Health Organization has recommended that member states develop self-harm surveillance systems as part of their suicide prevention efforts. This is also a priority under Australia\u2019s Fifth National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan. The aim of this paper is to describe the development of a state-based self-harm monitoring system in Victoria, Australia. In this system, data on all self-harm presentations are collected from eight hospital emergency departments in Victoria. A natural language processing classifier that uses machine learning to identify episodes of self-harm is currently being developed. This uses the free-text triage case notes, together with certain structured data fields, contained within the metadata of the incoming records. Post-processing is undertaken to identify primary mechanism of injury, substances consumed (including alcohol, illicit drugs and pharmaceutical preparations) and presence of psychiatric disorders. This system will ultimately leverage routinely collected data in combination with advanced artificial intelligence methods to support robust community-wide monitoring of self-harm. Once fully operational, this system will provide accurate and timely information on all presentations to participating emergency departments for self-harm, thereby providing a useful indicator for Australia\u2019s suicide prevention efforts."

This study investigated geographical variations in the prevalence of stunting sub-nationally, and the determinants of stunting among children under 5 years of age in Ethiopia. We used the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) dataset for children aged 0\u201359 months with valid anthropometric measurements and geographic coordinates (n = 9089). We modelled the prevalence of stunting and its determinants using Bayesian geospatially explicit regression models. The prevalence of stunting among children under five years was 36.3% (95% credible interval (CrI); 22.6%, 51.4%) in Ethiopia, with wide variations sub-nationally and by age group. The prevalence of childhood stunting ranged from 56.6% (37.4\u201374.6%) in the Mekelle Special zone of the Tigray region to 25.5% (10.5\u201348.9%) in the Sheka zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region. Factors associated with a reduced likelihood of stunting in Ethiopia included non-receipt of breastmilk, mother\u2019s BMI (overweight/obese), employment status (employed), and higher household wealth, while the enablers were residence in the \u201carid\u201d geographic areas, small birth size of the child, and mother\u2019s BMI (underweight). The prevalence and determinants of stunting varied across Ethiopia. Efforts to reduce the burden of childhood stunting should consider geographical heterogeneity and modifiable risk factors."

The writing is personal, binding together a considerable body of knowledge without major overlap or internal contradiction. However, he has utilized a variety of sources and submitted individual chapters to specialists in other fields for reading and criticism. The symptoms, therefore, seem not to grow out of childhood development but rather to arise as expressions of individual symptomatology in a particular child.

Although the overall prevalence of HIV in Nepal is relatively low, there are specific sub-populations where the prevalence is far higher than the national average. One of these sub-groups is male people who inject drugs (male PWIDs). In order to understand the reasons for the differences in prevalence, a series of socio-demographic, behavioural and knowledge-based risk factors need to be assessed. The study used a series of 7 cross-sectional survey datasets from Pokhara (Nepal), collected between 2003 and 2017 (N\u2009=\u20092235) to investigate trends in HIV prevalence among male PWIDs by socio-demographic and behavioural and knowledge-based risk factors. A series of logistic regression models were conducted to investigate the association between study factors and HIV. HIV prevalence decreased from the levels seen in 2003 (22.0%) and 2005 (21.7%), with the lowest prevalence recorded in 2015 (2.6%), however prevalence has increased in the most recent period (4.9%). A lower risk of HIV was associated with younger age (<=24\u2009years compared to >\u200924\u2009years, OR\u2009=\u20090.17, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.10\u20130.31), being married (OR\u2009=\u20091.91, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.25\u20133.02) and shorter duration of drug use (<=4\u2009years compared to >\u20094\u2009years, OR\u2009=\u20090.16, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.09\u20130.29). A higher risk of HIV was associated with low (compared to secondary or higher) education level (OR\u2009=\u20092.76, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.75\u20134.36), a lack of addiction treatment (OR\u2009=\u20092.59, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.64\u20134.08), and recent use of unsterilized injection equipment (OR\u2009=\u20092.22, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.20\u20134.11 \u2026"

                "abstract": "Queensland, Australia has been rapidly developing its coal seam gas (CSG) resources over the past decade. CSG forms the basis for the expanding liquefied natural gas industry in Australia (1). Likewise, in recent years, the energy sector in the United States has undergone a significant transformation due to the exploitation of shale gas resources (2). While these two types of unconventional natural gas are often seen as similar, health implications from studies based on shale gas cannot be translated directly to the CSG context because of several differences including geological formations, processes, and regulatory frameworks (3, 4).However, a common concern is the potential human health impact that would result from exposure to environmental media, such as water, air, and soil, that could be contaminated during gas development activities (1). There is also the potential for psychosocial stress and related health impacts (5). The two main stages of unconventional natural gas development are well development and production (6), and the activities conducted during the well development stage (eg, construction, pad preparation, well drilling and completion) would present the most environmental change. Therefore, it is likely that this stage presents the greatest likelihood for exposures related to unconventional natural gas development (eg, to VOCs, diesel exhaust)."

Treatment indicators are located in a companion report. BreastScreen Aotearoa (BSA) has offered government funded biennial mammography screening for all NZ women aged 50-64 years since 1999. In July 2004 the target age group was extended to include women aged 45-49 years and 65-69 years.Targets are provided for indicators for women aged 50-69 years. Due to the paucity of trial and screening service evidence, there is insufficient data on which to base targets for the screening of women under 50 years at present. Therefore, BSA and provider performance for the 45-49 years age group is documented throughout the report, but there are no specific recommendations. Trend data for key indicators are presented for women aged 50-64 years until a new time-series was established for the expanded target age group of women aged 50-69 years. Some indicators in this report have \u2018expected\u2019and \u2018desirable\u2019targets. In the text of this Executive Summary quoted targets relate to \u2018expected\u2019target values. Both the magnitude of differences, and their statistical significance, are used to assess the relation of observed to target values. Differences of< 5% in magnitude from the target value and/or differences which are not significantly different from the target value are considered \u2018on target\u2019(see \u2018Technical notes for interpreting this report\u2019)."

Method: Self-harm events presenting to the emergency department (October 2017 to August 2020) were identified using clinical documentation and a new reporting field. Changes in the frequency of self-harm in the period after implementation of the self-harm field were assessed through Poisson regression models.

                "abstract": "Background As oesophageal cancer has short survival, it is likely pre-diagnosis health behaviours will have carry-over effects on post-diagnosis survival times. Cancer registry data sets do not usually contain pre-diagnosis health behaviours and so need to be augmented with data from external health surveys. A new algorithm is introduced and tested to augment cancer registries with external data when one-to-one data linkage is not available.   Methods The algorithm is to use external health survey data to impute pre-diagnosis health behaviour for cancer patients, estimate misclassification errors in these imputed values and then fit misclassification corrected Cox regression to quantify the association between pre-diagnosis health behaviour and post-diagnosis survival. Data from US cancer registries and a US national health survey are used in testing the algorithm.   Results It is demonstrated that the algorithm works effectively on simulated smoking data when there is no age confounding. But age confounding does exist (risk of death increases with age and most health behaviours change with age) and interferes with the performance of the algorithm. The estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) of pre-diagnosis smoking was HR = 1.32 (95% CI 0.82,2.68) with HR = 1.93 (95% CI 1.08,7.07) in the squamous cell sub-group and pre-diagnosis physical activity was protective of survival with HR = 0.25 (95% CI 0.03, 0.81). But the method failed for less common behaviours (such as heavy drinking).   Conclusions Further improvements in the I2C2 algorithm will permit enrichment of cancer registry data through imputation of new variables with negligible risk \u2026"

Data linkage is not feasible when there are no cases in common between data sets. We present a novel approach to augmenting cancer registry data by imputing pre-diagnosis health behaviour and estimating its relationship with post-diagnosis survival time. Six measures of pre-diagnosis health behaviours (focussing on tobacco smoking, \u2018at risk\u2019 alcohol consumption, overweight and exercise) were imputed for 28,000 cancer registry data records of US oesophageal cancers using cold deck imputation from an unrelated health behaviour dataset. Each data point was imputed twice. This calibration allowed us to estimate the misclassification rate. We applied statistical correction for the misclassification to estimate the relative risk of dying within 1 year of diagnosis for each of the imputed behaviour variables. Subgroup analyses were conducted for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma separately. Simulated survival data confirmed that accurate estimates of true relative risks could be retrieved for health behaviours with greater than 5% prevalence, although confidence intervals were wide. Applied to real datasets, the estimated relative risks were largely consistent with current knowledge. For example, tobacco smoking status 5\u2009years prior to diagnosis was associated with an increased age-adjusted risk of all cause death within 1 year of diagnosis for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (RR\u2009=\u20091.99 95% CI 1.24,3.12) but not oesophageal adenocarcinoma RR\u2009=\u20091.61, 95% CI 0.79,2.57).

This study used routinely collected PMHC data (2005\u20132018), population-level general practice and Medicare rebates data (2013\u20132018) related to mental health conditions, for the population catchment of the Western Sydney PHN. Sex- and age-specific PMHC referrals were examined by socio-demographic, diagnostic, referral- and service-level factors, and age-specific referrals to PMHC services as a percentage of total mental health encounters were investigated. There were 27,897 referrals received for 20,507 clients, of which, 79.19% referrals resulted in follow-up services with 138,154 sessions. Overall, 60.09% clients were female, and median age was 31 years with interquartile ranged 16\u201346 years. Anxiety and depression were the predominant mental health condition, and 9.88% referred for suicidal risk. Over two-thirds of referrals started treatments during the first month of the referral and 95.1% of the total sessions were delivered by face to face.

Despite this, limited research has explored the relationship between Indigeneity and the clinical management of hospital-treated deliberate self-harm. A retrospective clinical cohort study (2003\u20132012) at a regional referral centre (NSW) for deliberate self-poisoning was used to explore the magnitude and direction of the relationship between Indigeneity and discharge destination (psychiatric hospital vs. other) using a series of logistic regressions. There were 149 (4%) Indigenous and 3697 (96%) non-Indigenous deliberate self-poisoning admissions during the study period. One-third (31%) were referred to the psychiatric hospital at discharge; Indigenous 21% (n = 32) vs. non-Indigenous 32% (n = 1175). Those who identified as Indigenous were less likely to be discharged to the psychiatric hospital, OR 0.59 (0.40\u20130.87) at the univariate level, with little change after sequential adjustment; and AOR 0.34 (0.21\u20130.73) in the fully adjusted model. The Indigenous cohort had a lower likelihood of psychiatric hospital discharge even after adjustment for variables associated with discharge to the psychiatric hospital highlighting the need for further investigation of the reasons accounting for this differential pattern of clinical management and the effectiveness of differential after-care allocation."

Yet there is currently not a set of agreed comprehensive indicators in Australia. We have developed 79 evidence-based indicators and their corresponding 129 measures of high-quality general practice. This study aims to achieve consensus on relevant and feasible indicators and measures for the Australian context.   Methods This Delphi consensus study, approved by WSU Human Research Ethics Committee, consists of three rounds of online survey with general practice experts including general practitioners, practice nurses and primary health network staff. The identified indicators and measures are grouped under an attribute framework aligned with the Quadruple Aim, and further grouped under structures, processes and outcomes according to the Donabedian framework. Participants will rate each indicator and measure for relevance and feasibility, and provide comments and recommendations of additional indicators or measures. In the last round, participants will also be asked their views on the implementation of a quality indicator tool. Each indicator and measure will require \u226570% agreement in both relevance and feasibility to achieve consensus. Aggregated ratings will be statistically analysed for response rates, level of agreement, medians, interquartile ranges and group rankings. Qualitative responses will be analysed thematically using a mixed inductive and deductive approach.

Clinical and psychosocial correlates of DV have been documented internationally, but evidence from South Asia is limited, especially among men. This is a nested cross-sectional study of the control population (N = 856) of a large case-control study in Kandy, Sri Lanka. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the association between clinical and psychosocial factors and experience of DV. Overall associations were examined and stratified by sex and type of abuse. Overall, 19% (95% CI 16%-21%) of the sample reported DV of any form in past year, with a similar prevalence being reported in both men (18% 95% CI 14%\u201322%) and women (19% 95% CI 15%\u201323%). Depression symptoms (adjusted OR [AOR] 3.28 95% CI 2.13\u20135.05), suicidal ideation (AOR 6.19 95% CI 3.67\u201310.45), prior diagnosis of a mental illness (AOR 3.62 95% CI 1.61\u20138.14), and previous self-harm (AOR 6.99 95% CI 3.65\u201313.38) were strongly associated with DV, as were indicators of perceived poor social support (AOR range 2.48\u201314.18).

Methods: A data linkage study and descriptive ecological study of PMHC referrals investigated the trends in referrals, treatment attendance, hospital-treated self-harm, and health care practitioners (HCPs) for the period of 2013\u22122018 (n = 19,437). Results: There was a substantial increase in referrals from 2016. The majority of referrals were females (60.9%), those aged <45 years (71.3%), and those presenting with anxiety or affective disorders (78.9%). Referrals of those at risk of suicide increased from 9.7% in 2013 to 17.8% in 2018. There were 264 (2.2%) cases of subsequent hospital-treated self-harm, with higher rates among those at risk of suicide and those who attended <6 sessions. The number of HCPs per referral also increased from 2013, as did waiting times for treatment initiation. Conclusion: Individuals presenting to PMHC services at risk of suicide, and who subsequently presented to a hospital setting following self-harm, were more likely to either not attend services following a referral or to attend fewer services. This trend occurred in the context of an increase in the number of clients per HCP, suggesting workforce capacity has not kept pace with demand."

Clinical and psychosocial correlates of DV have been documented internationally, but evidence from South Asia is limited, especially among men. This is a nested cross-sectional study of the control population (N= 856) of a large case-control study in Kandy, Sri Lanka. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the association between clinical and psychosocial factors and experience of DV. Overall associations were examined and stratified by sex and type of abuse. Overall, 19%(95% CI 16%-21%) of the sample reported DV of any form in past year, with a similar prevalence being reported in both men (18% 95% CI 14%\u201322%) and women (19% 95% CI 15%\u201323%). Depression symptoms (adjusted OR [AOR] 3.28 95% CI 2.13\u20135.05), suicidal ideation (AOR 6.19 95% CI 3.67\u201310.45), prior diagnosis of a mental illness (AOR 3.62 95% CI 1.61\u20138.14), and previous self-harm (AOR 6.99 95% CI 3.65\u201313.38) were strongly associated with DV, as were indicators of perceived poor social support (AOR range 2.48\u201314.18). The presence of in-laws (AOR 2.16 95% CI 1.34\u20133.48), having three or more children (AOR 2.15 95% CI 1.05\u20134.41) and being divorced/separated/widowed were also strongly associated with DV (AOR 2.89 95% CI 1.14\u20137.36). There was no statistical evidence that any associations differed by sex. A multi-sectoral approach is needed to address DV in this context. Enhanced coordination between DV support services and mental health services may be beneficial. Further research \u2026"

Although the overall prevalence of HIV in Nepal is relatively low and the country itself is considered low risk, there are specific sub-populations where the prevalence is far higher than the national average. One of these sub-groups is male injection drug users (IDUs). In order to understand the reasons for the differences in prevalence, a series of socio-demographic, behavioural and knowledge-based risk factors need to be assessed. Methods The study used a series of 7 cross-sectional survey datasets, collected between 2003 and 2017 (N= 2,235) to investigate trends in HIV prevalence among male IDUs by key socio-demographic and behavioural and knowledge-based risk factors. A series of logistic regression models were conducted to investigate the association between study factors and HIV in the Pokhara valley, Nepal. Results A lower risk of HIV was associated with younger age (\u2264 24 years compared to> 24 years, OR= 0.17, 95% CI= 0.10, 0.31), not being married (OR= 0.51, 95% CI= 0.33, 0.80) and shorter duration of drug use (\u2264 4 years compared to> 4 years, OR= 0.16, 95% CI= 0.09, 0.29). A higher risk of HIV was associated with low (compared to secondary or higher) education level (OR= 2.76, 95% CI= 1.75, 4.36), a lack of addiction treatment (OR= 2.59, 95% CI= 1.64, 4.08), and recent use of unsterilized injection equipment (OR= 2.22, 95% CI= 1.20, 4.11).

TAU is a configurable, open-source computer simulation of a university using a contact network based on publicly available information about university classes, residences, and activities. is study evaluates health outcomes for an array of interventions and testing protocols in an artificial university of 6,500 students, faculty, and staff. Findings suggest that physical distancing and centralized contact tracing are most effective at reducing infections, but there is a tipping point for compliance below which physical distancing is less effective. If student compliance is anything short of high, it helps to have separate buildings for quarantining infected students, thereby gracefully increasing compliance. Hybrid in-person and online classes and closing fitness centers do not significantly change cumulative infections but do significantly decrease the number of the infected at any given time, indicating strategies for \u201cflattening the curve\u201d to protect limited resources. Supplementing physical distancing with centralized contact tracing decreases infected individuals by an additional 14%; boosting frequency of testing for student-facing staff yields a further 7% decrease. A trade-off exists between increasing the sheer number of infection tests and targeting testing for key nodes in the contact network (ie, student-facing staff). ere are significant advantages to getting and acting on test results quickly. e costs and benefits to universities of these findings are discussed.

We postulated that, with a large data set, using estimated propensity for a behavior as a predictor of survival times could provide useful insight as to the impact of actual behavior.Methods: Data from a national health survey and logistic regression were used to calculate the propensity of selected health behaviors from participant\u2019s demographic characteristics for each esophageal cancer case within a large cancer registry data base. The associations between survival time and the propensity of the health behaviors were investigated using Cox regression.Results: Observed associations include: a 0.1 increase in the probability of smoking one year prior to diagnosis was detrimental to survival (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.21, 95% CI 1.19, 1.23); a 0.1 increase in the probability of hazardous alcohol consumption 10 years prior to diagnosis was associated with decreased survival in squamous cell cancer (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07, 1.56) but not adenocarcinoma (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94, 1.25); a 0.1 increase in the probability of physical activity outside the workplace is protective (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.81, 0.84).Conclusions: We conclude that propensity for health behavior estimated from demographic characteristics can assist in determining existence of the association between pre-diagnosis health behavior and post-diagnosis health outcomes, allowing some sharing information across otherwise \u2026"

MHR is designed to be an effective digital system of shared and connected patient information to support improved health care with the introduction giving healthcare organisations the opportunity for faster, easier access to important summary health information for their patients. While there is some evidence that MHR improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian health system, a consistent improvement of quality care has not yet been demonstrated and potentially may also be increasing healthcare provider workload. The present study aimed to qualitatively examine how MHR may impact on clinicians and consumers by potentially improving work efficiency, reducing time spent on communication with other clinicians, improving medication safety, and reducing duplicative diagnostic imaging and pathology testing. Findings from this research reveal several insights into the primary care experience, in the Western Sydney Primary Health Network region, around satisfaction and impact of MHR on daily practice. The most promising finding is the positive perceptions of MHR among these primary care providers, despite current low usage coupled with the limitations and challenges outlined in this study.

Male suicide rates were lower in areas with targeted suicide prevention activity (and higher levels of funding) compared with areas receiving no activity both during and after implementation, with rates declining faster in areas with targeted activity than in those without (13% v. 10% decline). However, these differences were reduced and were no longer statistically significant following adjustment for sociodemographic variables. There was no difference in female \u2026"

In most people, MS follows a relapsing-remitting course at least in its earlier stages. The overall progressive nature of the disorder, the eventual debilitation, and the peak age of onset of 30-49 years result in high levels of support and medical care being required and significant loss of productivity in the workforce. We examined trends in dispensed use of disease modifying drugs (DMD) for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Australia from 1996 to 2011."

In late 2007 a survey was sent to General Practitioners residing in Queensland (approx 5000) through the Medical Board of Queensland. In addition, information on case-load, location, employment of a Practice Nurse; links to liver clinics; and current HIV prescribing was gathered.The data and analysis of the survey results will be presented as well as future directions for treatment in Queensland.

For other indicators (e.g. re-screen rates, treatment data) the biennial data presented relates only to women 50-64 years. An additional development in the current reporting period was the restructuring of BreastScreen Auckland & North (BSAN) into three lead providers BreastScreen Auckland Limited (BSAL), BreastScreen Counties Manukau (BSCM), and BreastScreen Waitemata (BSWN).

South Australia is the fifth largest state in Australia, with a population of 1,427,936 in 1996. In 1990-1991, Australian Bureau of Statistics data recorded the farm population to be 45,875, residing on 14,482 agricultural holdings. Therefore the farming population represents approximately 3.2% of the state population. The most commonly produced commodities include sheep and lambs, cereal crops for grain, and meat cattle.South Australian farmers have a death rate 50% higher than the Australian male rate for the period 1990-1993. For the period 1991-1996, there was a total of 55 farm injury related deaths, of which 20% were children aged less than 15 years. These data suggest that on average there are nine deaths on all South Australian farms per annum. Machinery in operation was the largest external cause of death, with mobile farm machinery/plant and tractors predominating. Children aged less than 15 years accounted for 11 deaths in South Australia, of which five involved machinery in operation."

These groups have limited access to healthcare and social security, work in high-risk jobs, and have higher rates of comorbidities associated with poor outcomes from COVID-19. This study quantifies the effect of individual demographics, socioeconomic factors, and public health measures on COVID-19 health outcomes in a large population.Method: Demographics, socioeconomic factors, and COVID-19 outcomes for all 600,000 residents of the Sydney Local Health District from June 2021 to February 2022 were identified from the state\u2019s Notifiable Conditions Information Management System (NCIMS) and linked to Australian Census data. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were generated for the outcomes of testing, infection, hospitalisation, and death for different periods of public health restrictions.Findings: Overall, public health interventions were effective in protecting the entire population from COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and death. During strict public health measures, older individuals had a lower risk of infection, with those aged 80 years and over having half the risk of infection compared to the reference group of 30 to 39 years old (hazards ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.45-0.49); and those living in areas of lower socioeconomic status (SES) had a higher risk of infection, with the lowest areas having seven times the risk compared to the highest areas (HR 7.15, 6.24-8.19). The risk of infection was also higher for males (HR 1.34 1.27-1.40); those living in areas with higher household \u2026"

Sex and age frequency matched controls were recruited from the hospital\u2019s outpatient department (N= 490) and local population (N= 450). Exposure to DV was collected through the Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, Kick (HARK) questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the association between DV and self-poisoning, and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated.Results Exposure to at least one type of DV within the previous 12 months was strongly associated with self-poisoning for women (adjusted OR [AOR] 4\u00b7 08, 95% CI 1\u00b7 60-4\u00b7 78) and men (AOR 2\u00b7 52, 95% CI 1\u00b7 51-4\u00b7 21), compared to those reporting no abuse. Among women, the association was strongest for physical violence (AOR 14\u00b7 07, 95% CI 5\u00b7 87-33\u00b7 72), whereas among men, emotional abuse showed the highest risk (AOR 2\u00b7 75, 95% CI 1\u00b7 57-4\u00b7 82).

Low levels of distress have been estimated to result in productivity falls of 6.4%, and as distress increases to moderate, and then to high levels, the productivity falls are 9.4% and 20.9% respectively. 10 Further, suicide results in $1.7 bn of lost lifetime productivity. 11 There is a clear social, economic (and moral) imperative to explore ways to more effectively improve mental health in this country."

This often involves legislation, regulation, enforcement, incentives, and programs of multiple packaged interventions, which need to be integrated into dynamic health and socio-political environments. The use of research evidence to underpin public health policy is advocated to improve the effectiveness of policy and population-level interventions, and knowledge translation tools have been developed to facilitate this process. However, current approaches often don\u2019t provide decision makers with adequate guidance for the design of effective multi-dimensional policy responses.Discussion: This paper discusses the analytic and methodological limitations of current knowledge translation approaches.

They are one of the most extensively studied groups of enzymes and the literature is rich in research papers dating back from the 19th century. Nevertheless, peroxidases continue to be widely studied, with more than 2000 articles already published in 2002 (according to the Institute for Scientific Information).The importance of peroxidases is emphasised by their wide distribution among living organisms and by their multiple physiological roles. They have been divided into three superfamilies according to their source and mode of action: plant peroxidases, animal peroxidases and catalases. Among all peroxidases, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has received a special attention and will be the focus of this review. A brief description of the three super-families is included in the first section of this review. In the second section, a comprehensive description of the present state of knowledge of the structure and catalytic action of HRP is presented. The physiological role of peroxidases in higher plants is described in the third section. And finally, the fourth section addresses the applications of peroxidases, especially HRP, in the environmental and health care sectors, and in the pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnological industries."

This paper reviews the state of the art on ethanol determination based on AOX sensors, using either electrochemical electrodes or immobilised enzyme reactors.Almost all AOX-based ethanol sensors developed so far are based on the monitoring of O2 consumption or H2O2 formation. This has been mostly achieved using amperometric electrodes set at appropriate potentials namely, \u2212600 mV for O2 monitoring or +600 mV for H2O2 monitoring. Mediated \u2026"

Owing to the commercial interest in these approaches, the development of production and purification strategies for gene-therapy vectors has been performed in pharmaceutical companies within a confidential environment. Consequently, the information on large-scale plasmid purification is scarce and usually not available to the scientific community. This article reviews downstream operations for the large-scale purification of plasmid DNA, describing their principles and the strategy used to attain a final product that meets specifications."

This paper gives an overview of the use of pDNA chromatography. The specificity of pDNA purification and the consequent limitations to the performance of chromatography are described. Strategies currently used to overcome those limitations, as well as other possible solutions are presented. Applications of the different types of chromatography to the purification of therapeutic pDNA are reviewed, and the main advantages and disadvantages behind each technique highlighted."

NaCl gradient elution enabled the isolation of supercoiled plasmid from low-Mr RNA, cDNA and plasmid variants. A compact covalently closed, supercoiled form of denatured plasmid carrying large stretches of single-stranded DNA was identified as one of the major contaminants. Anion-exchange HPLC on a Poros QE 20 column was used to quantify plasmid yield. Supercoiled plasmid was recovered in a single fraction with a 62\u00b18% yield. Loadings higher than 40 \u03bcg/ml gel could be used but at the expense of a loss of resolution between open circular and \u2026"

This paper discusses the progress and importance of affinity chromatography (AC) for the purification of pDNA-based therapeutic products. Several affinity approaches have already been successfully developed for a variety of applications, and we will focus here on highlighting their possible contributions to the pDNA purification challenge. Diverse affinity applications and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed, as well as the most significant results and improvements in the challenging task of purifying plasmids."

Isolation of dengue virus provides the most direct and conclusive approach to diagnosis, despite the demand for high\u2010level equipment, technical skills and manpower. However, it is useless in early diagnosis because several days are required to isolate and classify the virus. Serology, despite being simpler, is not able to afford an accurate early diagnosis in primary infections because 4\u20135 days are required for the immune system to produce a sufficient amount of antibodies. Moreover, it leads to misleading results in secondary infections owing to cross\u2010reactivity among serotype\u2010specific antibodies and with other flavivirus \u2026"

Screening of the best conditions for ATPS extraction was performed using three PEG molecular weights (300, 400 and 600) and varying the tie-line length, phase volume ratio and lysate load. For a 20% (w/w) lysate load, the best results were obtained with PEG 600 using the shortest tie-line (38.16%, w/w).

The method is rapid (each analysis takes 7 min), reproducible, easy to perform and does not require previous digestion of RNA in samples with RNase or other pre-treatment. Furthermore, it is capable of handling heavily contaminated samples, with less than 5% of plasmid DNA thus constituting a good alternative to other less robust analytical techniques currently in use."

After 2 h of incubation at 35\u00b0C, the remaining activity of the enzyme in the presence of 30% of each solvent was less than 30%, with exception of DMSO for which the enzyme remained fully active.In order to increase stability, HRP was covalently immobilised onto silica microparticles. The half-life of the enzyme in buffer at 50\u00b0C increased from 2 to 52 h when the enzyme was immobilised. The stability of both free and immobilised HRP was also studied at 50\u00b0C in \u2026"

Anion\u2010exchange HPLC was used as a routine technique for monitoring plasmid purity in process streams. The use of RNase or high temperatures during alkaline lysis was proved unnecessary. Instead, RNA could be completely removed by performing sequentially clarification with a chaotropic salt, concentration with PEG, and ion\u2010exchange and size\u2010exclusion chromatography.

The ISFET measurements are performed with an external Ag/AgCl microreference electrode immersed in 100 mM phosphate buffer electrolyte with pH 7.0. Threshold voltage shifts in the transfer curve of the ISFETs are observed resulting from successive steps of surface chemical functionalization, covalent DNA attachment to the functionalized surface, surface blocking, and hybridization with a complementary target. The surface sensitivity achieved for DNA oligonucleotides is of the order of 1 pmol/cm2. Point-of-zero charge estimations were made for the functionalized surfaces and for the device \u2026"

Several challenges encountered in the gene therapy field have emphasized the need for the development of novel platforms that allow the recovery of gene vectors and enable efficient transfection of cells. The use of plasmid DNA\u2010based therapeutics relies on procedures that efficiently purify the supercoiled (sc) plasmid isoform. Plasmid DNA (pDNA) purification strategies that use amino acids as immobilized ligands have recently yielded interesting results.The present study describes a strategy that uses arginine\u2010chromatography to specifically purify sc pDNA from other isoforms and Escherichia coli impurities present in a clarified lysate.Control analysis shows that the purity of the sc pDNA is 100% with a homogeneity higher than 97% of sc \u2026"

The effects of the lysate mass loaded to the ATPS (20, 40, and 60% w/w) and of the plasmid concentration in the lysate were evaluated. The performance of the process was determined by qualitative and quantitative assays, carefully established to overcome the strong interference of impurities (protein, genomic DNA, RNA), salt, and PEG.Plasmid DNA partitioned to the top phase when PEG molecular weight was lower than 400. The bottom phase was preferred when higher PEG molecular weights were used. Aqueous two\u2010phase systems with PEG 300, 600, and 1000 were chosen for further studies on the basis of \u2026"

It was observed that the enzyme immobilised over most of the zeolites used (NaA, NaX, NaY, NaUSY and modified forms) was active for this reaction, although the specific activity depended strongly on the structure and composition of the zeolite support. This preliminary study of the use of zeolites as supports for enzymes was also extended by the analysis of the influence of the water content and of the thermal stability of one of the preparations. It can be concluded that the prospective use of zeolites as supports for enzymes in reactions involving organic media is very promising."

The effects of the zeolite framework composition (including cation nature) and acidity were studied. The results were compared with other commonly used supports: polyamide Accurel-PA6, silica and alumina. Both the nature of the cation and the silica:alumina (Si:Al) ratio of the framework revealed to be important parameters. The most promising results were obtained for supports with little acidity and with lower Si:Al ratio. This last observation is in accordance with the results obtained with silica and alumina."

The influence of relevant parameters in the catalytic activity such as temperature, pH, surfactant and substrate concentrations, and water content was tested and compared in both media. A study of stability of the lipase was carried out, with particular reference to the influence of pH.Three major effects of the encapsulation of the lipase in the micelles were observed: increased activity (up to 7 times higher than in water), greater stability, specially at pH 7, and higher resistance to thermal deactivation."

The results show that the arginine matrix promotes multiple interactions with pDNA, including not only electrostatic and hydrophobic but also biorecognition of nucleotide bases by the arginine ligand. The strong interactions occurring with DNA backbone provide stability, conducting to high effectiveness of arginine support to bind pDNA at low ionic strength. The specific interaction of arginine with sc pDNA could be due to the ability of arginine matrix to be involved in complex interactions that are partly dependent on the conformation of the DNA molecule."

One of the main obstacles during the developmental stages of a new therapeutic DNA molecule involves tackling a wide array of structural instability events occurring in/with pDNA and therefore assuring its structural integrity. This review focuses on major instability determinants in pDNA. Their elimination could be considered an important step towards the design of safer and more efficient plasmid molecules. Particular emphasis is given to mutations triggered by the presence of repeated sequences, instability events occurring during plasmid intracellular routing, instability mediated by insertion sequences and host genome integration."

The role of water and organic solvent are evaluated, namely the increase in the volumetric productivity of the reaction system and the shift of the reaction equilibrium in favour of product synthesis. High product yields have been obtained due to the reduction of substrate/product inhibition. Biocatalyst stability in the presence of the organic phase was also performed."

It is the first of a series that starts with the identification of flow patterns inside the device and goes up to the assessment of its performance as an enzymatic reactor. Our approach is to study in depth one single geometric configuration (radius ratio \u03b7=0.677 and aspect ratio \u0393=18.30), adequate for use as a heterogeneous reactor and/or adsorption system in bio-processes, rather than spanning a range of geometries and proposing empirical expressions for mass transport coefficients. The range of rotations and axial flow rates used here correspond to low/moderate rotational Reynolds numbers (Re\u03b8 from 130 to 615, with 1.6<Re\u03b8/Re\u03b8,c<7.7) and low axial ones (Reax from 0.172 to 1.067).

The stability of free AOX was dependent of pH, buffer and additives but independent of protein concentration. More than 80% of the initial activity was retained after 9 h in the presence of additives, such as lactose, dextran sulphate and PEG 400 and combinations thereof. In the specific case of 0.01% dextran sulphate and 50 mM lactose no activity was lost for 9 h. Salts (ammonium sulphate and chloride) had a strong destabilising effect on the enzyme.The immobilisation of AOX onto controlled-pore glass (CPG) beads allowed the use of mini packed-bed bioreactors (31 mm3) to monitor ethanol concentration. The conversion decrease (80% after 4 h) during continuous oxidation of ethanol at 32 \u00b0C in phosphate buffer was attributed to inactivation by hydrogen peroxide rather than thermal deactivation. Accordingly, an in situ \u2026"

Nucleic acids purified from E. coli were injected separately in the above HIC column and eluted with 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 in the buffer. The column was able to separate single-stranded from double-stranded nucleic acids.

The aqueous bioconversion phase and the organic phase were maintained apart with the aid of the membrane. The extraction of alcohol and aldehyde was evaluated by performing equilibrium and mass transfer kinetic studies. The bioprocess was then performed in a continuous mode with addition of the substrate to the aqueous phase. Fresh solvent was added to the organic phase and exhausted solvent was removed at the same flow rate.

These applications require high amounts of pure supercoiled plasmid DNA vectors to transport genes to the nuclei of target cells. Plasmid vectors are usually produced in Escherichia coli by fermentation. Plasmids are isolated mostly by the alkaline lysis procedure, designed to disrupt cell walls and denature proteins and genomic DNA. At this stage, the supercoiled plasmid structures unwind and the hydrogen bonding between bases is disrupted in certain segments of the double strand. If the pH is kept below 12.5, anchor base pairs remain, preventing the complete separation of complementary strands, and serving as nuclei for the complete renaturation of plasmid molecules during the subsequent neutralization step with potassium acetate (1). If lysis is carried out at a \u2026"

Factors that are also important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme such as immobilization pH, ionic strength, and pH of the reaction medium and temperature were optimized. The selected conditions for further work were pH 9 (the immobilization pH) and 30\u00b0C.

DNA immobilization and hybridization times are 100 ns and 10 \u03bcs, respectively, about 109 times faster than the corresponding passive reactions without electric field. Surface coverage is comparable. Duration, magnitude and slew rate of the voltage pulse are all key factors controlling the rates of ssDNA immobilization and hybridization. With rise times of 4.5 ns, pulses shorter than 1 ms and voltages below 1 V are effective. The ssDNA adsorbed on the surface is reoriented by the rapidly changing electric field. This reduces steric barriers and speeds the immobilization and hybridization reactions. These results open \u2026"

In natural plasmids, we observed an overrepresentation of close direct repeats in comparison to inverted ones and a preferential location of repeats with high recombination potential in intergenic regions, suggesting a highly plastic and dynamic behavior. In plasmid vectors, we found a high density of repeats within eukaryotic promoters and non-coding sequences. As a result of this \u2026"

With the exception of rotational Reynolds numbers (Re\u03b8) close to the critical value, downstream displacement of vortices was slower than the fluid's superficial velocity. One specific geometry was focused (radius ratio \u03b7=0.677 and aspect ratio \u0393=18.30). This work presents a lumped-parameter model of this system that uses empirical values of the vortex drift velocity, Vd (the ratio between the speed of the vortex core and the fluid's superficial velocity). The model has two mass transfer parameters, estimated after injections of a tracer \u2026"

In order to avoid these high back pressures, expanded bed anion exchange chromatography was evaluated as an alternative to fixed bed chromatography. A Streamline 25 column filled with 100 ml of Streamline QXL media, was equilibrated with 0.5 M NaCl in TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH=8.0) buffer at an upward flow of 300 cmh-1, E. coli lysates (obtained from up to 3 liters of fermentation broth) were injected in the column.

A two-liquid-phase system, composed of water and isooctane (v/v, 1/1), was particularly suited for a significant accumulation of the aldehyde: Acetobacter sp. ALEG furnished 9 g/l of phenylacetaldehyde within 4 h starting from 10 g/l of alcohol and still 8 g/l were recovered after 24 h in the organic phase, whereas strain ALEF gave 3.5 g/l of aldehyde from 5.0 g/l of substrate. Acetobacter sp. ALEG also showed satisfactory long-term stability, being able to perform the transformation with 80% of the original activity after 3 days of contact with the solvent."

Water filled micelles were supplemented to the reactor together with the substrate/solvent solution to compensate for the permeation of reversed micelles. The influence of substrate concentration, residence time and water content in the productivity and conversion of the system were investigated. A linear relationship between productivity and conversion degree was found for each substrate concentration tested. Operational stability of the bioreactor was tested in a long term operation confirming the high stability of this catalytic system."

New pDNA production strains have been created by rationally mutating genes selected on the basis of Escherichia coli central metabolism and plasmid properties. Nevertheless, the highly mutagenized genetic background of the strains used makes it difficult to ascertain the exact impact of those mutations. To explore the effect of strain genetic background, we investigated single and double knockouts of two genes, pykF and pykA, which were known to enhance pDNA synthesis in two different E. coli strains: MG1655 (wild-type genetic background) and DH5\u03b1 (highly mutagenized genetic background). The knockouts were only effective in the wild-type strain MG1655, demonstrating the relevance of strain genetic background and the importance of \u2026"

Hydrated reversed micelles permeated through the membrane together with the substrate ester, dipeptide, and by-products. However, as a result of the low solubility of the peptide in the reaction medium, selective precipitation occurred, thus enabling the complete retention of the solid product by the ultrafiltration membrane and therefore an integration of a separation step in the biotransformation process.

The work presented in this article outlines the development and optimization of an alternative hydrophobic interaction membrane chromatography process for the purification of pDNA. The studies included the modification of functionalized membrane supports with a linear alkyl chain ligand and the testing of chromatographic performance of these membranes.

In this work, different HIC ligands (phenyl, butyl, octyl), salts and salt concentrations were screened with the specific goal of replacing ammonium sulfate with an environmentally friendly salt.

Significant progress has been achieved in plasmid design and downstream processing, but there is still a demand for improved production strains. This review focuses on engineering of Escherichia coli strains for plasmid DNA production, understanding the differences between the traditional use of pDNA for recombinant protein production and its role as a biopharmaceutical.

When inserted in a full process, this tandem precipitation scheme represents a high economic and environmental impact due to the large amounts of the two precipitant agents and their environmental relevance. Thus, major goals of the study were the minimization of precipitants and the selection of the best operating conditions for high pDNA recovery and purity.

The enzyme was produced by mutant cells of Escherichia coli ATCC 9637, extracted from the periplasmic space by osmotic shock and further purified using a pseudo\u2010affinity adsorption process. Enzyme stabilisation attempts were performed with salts, alcohols and sugars. The highest levels of retained activity were obtained in the presence of 15% (w/v) ammonium or sodium sulfate. A kinetic model was proposed to describe the inactivation of penicillin acylase, taking into account results obtained in stability assays performed at different temperatures and with different enzyme concentrations. According to this model, the inactivation of penicillin acylase involves an intermediary active precursor of the enzyme, formed prior to dissociation into sub\u2010units.\u00a9 1999 Society of Chemical Industry"

The order in which the reactants were mixed showed a strong influence on catalytic activity.

Maximum activity was obtained at 750 mmol dm\u22123 calcium in the water pool of the micelles, which is an extremely high concentration when compared with the values reported in the literature.

Although \u223c30% of marketed drugs target GPCRs, their potential remains largely untapped. The discovery of new leads calls for the screening of thousands of compounds with high-throughput cell-based assays. Although microtiter plate-based high-throughput screening platforms are well established, microarray and microfluidic technologies hold potential for miniaturization, automation, and biosensor integration that may well redefine the format of GPCR screening assays. This paper reviews the latest research efforts directed to bringing microarray and microfluidic technologies into the realm of GPCR-based, live-cell screening assays."

In this work, we used synthetic homo\u2010deoxyoligonucleotides with different sizes (1\u201330 nucleotides long), to explore the effect of several conditions like hydrophobic character of the individual bases, presence of secondary structures, temperature, pH and salt concentration on the mechanism of retention of nucleic acids to histidine\u2013agarose support. One of the most striking results shows that histidine interacts preferentially with guanine, and the presence of secondary structures on polyA and polyG oligonucleotides has a significant influence on retention.

Although immunization against these infections would be an ideal solution, the development of effective vaccines has been hampered by specific challenges posed by parasitic pathogens. Plasmid-based DNA vaccines may prove to be promising immunization tools in this area because vectors can be designed to integrate several antigens from different stages of the parasite life cycle or different subspecies; vaccines, formulations and immunization protocols can be tuned to match the immune response that offers protective immunity; and DNA vaccination is an affordable platform for developing countries. Partial and full protective immunity have been reported following DNA vaccination against the most significant parasitic diseases in the world."

The results show that more than 97% of RNA in the lysate was removed during the process operations and that the plasmid DNA solution purity increased 28-fold. One of the main characteristics of the developed process is to avoid the use of large quantities of precipitating agents such as salts or alcohols.

Chromatographic experiments performed with three plasmids (2.7, 6.1 and 7.4 kbp) and with a decreasing ammonium sulphate gradient (2.3--2.0 M) showed that the retention of sc pDNA increased as temperature decreased from 24 to 5 \u00b0C. Such behaviour was attributed to the temperature-induced removal of negative superhelical turns in sc pDNA which is accompanied by a decrease in the number of dissociated base pairs responsible for interaction with the histidine ligands. CD spectroscopy showed that temperature has an important effect on plasmid secondary structure if adenine-rich inserts are present in the plasmid structure \u2026"

The potential application of arginine\u2010based chromatography to purify pDNA has been recently described in our work; however, to achieve higher efficiency and selectivity in arginine affinity chromatography, it is essential to characterize the behaviour of binding/elution of supercoiled (sc) isoforms. In this study, two different strategies based on increased sodium chloride (225\u2013250 mm) or arginine (20\u201370 mm) stepwise gradients are described to purify sc isoforms. Thus, it was proved that well\u2010defined binding/elution conditions are crucial to enhance the purification performance, resulting in an improvement of the final plasmids yields and transfection efficiency, as this could represent a significant impact on therapeutic applications of the purified sc isoform.

The present work discusses the recovery of hu-IFN\u03b12b IB from the E. coli cells. An optimized protocol is proposed based on the sequential evaluation of recovery steps and parameters: (i) cell disruption, (ii) IB recovery and separation from cell debris, (iii) IB washing, and (iv) IB solubilization. Parameters such as hu-IFN\u03b12b purity and recovery yield were measured after each step. The optimized recovery protocol yielded 60% of hu-IFN\u03b12b with a purity of up to 80%. The protein was renatured at high concentration after recovery and it was found to display biological activity."

As one of the foremost neglected illnesses, few resources have been available for the development of vaccines or new drugs, in spite of the current therapeutical drugs showing little efficiency and high toxicity. Hence, it is obviously important to widen effective therapeutics and preventive strategies against African trypanosomiasis. In this work, we use the DNA vaccine model to evaluate immunisation effectiveness in mice challenged with Trypanosoma brucei brucei. We demonstrate that Balb/C mice immunised intramuscularly with a single dose of a DNA plasmid encoding a bloodstream-stage specific invariant surface glycoprotein (ISG) are partially protected from a lethal dose of T. b. brucei.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of IL-polymer nanoparticle hybrid systems as tools to deliver poorly soluble drugs. These systems were obtained using a methodology previously developed by our group and improved herein to produce IL-polymer nanoparticle hybrid systems. Two different choline-based ILs and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) 50:50 or PLGA 75:25 were used to load rutin into the delivery system. The resulting rutin-loaded IL-polymer nanoparticle hybrid systems presented a diameter of 250\u2013300 nm, with a low polydispersity index and a zeta potential of about \u221240 mV. The drug association efficiency ranged from 51% to 76%, which represents a good achievement considering the poor solubility of rutin. No significant particle aggregation was obtained upon freeze-drying. The presence of the IL in the nanosystem does not affect its sustained release properties, achieving about 85% of rutin released after 72 h. The cytotoxicity studies showed that the delivery system was not toxic to HaCat cells. Our findings may open a new paradigm on the therapy improvement of diseases treated with poorly soluble drugs."

Simultaneous separation of the dipeptide was achieved by selective precipitation. Apart from the dipeptide, two by-products resulting from the hydrolysis and the transesterification of AcPheOEt with the cosolvent octanol were obtained. The dipeptide was recovered with high purity (higher than 92%) due to precipitation from the complex reaction medium. The influence of the concentration of the two substrates in performance parameters of the continuous reactor such as productivity, yields, conversion degree, selectivity, and operational stability was investigated. The integration of catalysis and separation in a ceramic membrane reactor led to a one-step process for the \u2026"

The response of different thin-film materials and plastic substrates to the immobilization procedure is discussed. The DNA probes immobilized in the patterned pixels were then allowed to hybridize with complementary target DNA labeled with a fluorescent molecule. A prototype array of thin film pixels of SiO2 functionalized by silanization deposited over a polyimide substrate is demonstrated."

Several membrane reactor configurations are analyzed, taking into account the type of bioconversion, biocatalyst type and location (either in the aqueous phase or in the membrane), membrane chemistry and morphology, solvent (extractant) type and its biocompatibility. Modeling of liquid-liquid extractive membrane bioreactors operation is also analyzed considering kinetics and mass-transfer aspects. The chapter includes examples from the authors\u2019 laboratory as well as other published in the field. Both enzyme and whole cell-based bioconversions are considered. Relevant aspects related to the solvent (extractant) toxicity and how the membrane could protect the biocatalytic activity are analyzed. Trends in this field are also given."

Several effects such as sample concentration and pH are discussed. The results show negligible effects of proteins concentration in electrowetting, although increased concentrations endorse passive adsorption mechanisms, which alter the local wettability of the substrates precluding droplet motion. Bioinspired surfaces promote the largest spreading diameter, which is beneficial for droplet motion. However, surface roughness promotes energy dissipation limiting the receding droplet motion.

The main objective of this work is the development of recombinant proteins specifically designed for pDNA delivery, which take advantage of molecular motors like dynein, for the transport of cargos from the periphery to the centrosome of mammalian cells. A DNA binding sequence was fused to the N-terminus of the recombinant human dynein light chain LC8. Expression studies indicated that the fusion protein was correctly expressed in soluble form using E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. As expected, gel permeation assays found the purified protein mainly present as dimers, the functional \u2026"

Yield and purity data were used to evaluate the economic and environmental impact of each option. Although pDNA yields =90% were always obtained, ATPS delivered the highest HPLC purity (59%), followed by PP (48%) and TFF (18%). However, the ability of ATPS to concentrate pDNA was very poor when compared with PP or TFF. Processes were also implemented by coupling TFF with ATPS or AS\u2010PP. Process simulations indicate that all options require large amounts of water (100\u2013200 tons/kg pDNA) and that the ATPS process uses large amounts of mass separating agents \u2026"

The oligonucleotides interacted differently with the column according to the molecular mass, the hydrophobic character of the individual bases, the secondary structure of the molecule and the concentration of ammonium sulphate in the eluent. The retention factor, k\u2032, was determined from the chromatographic profiles at different concentrations of ammonium sulphate. A linear relationship between log k\u2032 and the concentration of ammonium sulphate in the eluent was found for all oligonucleotides at the higher concentrations (>1.0 M) of ammonium sulphate. The slope of these plots, termed the hydrophobic interaction parameter, was found to be an increasing function of the number of nucleotides \u2026"

MC vectors are produced by replicating a parental plasmid (PP) and promoting its recombination in Escherichia coli. This generates a MC with the expression cassette, and a miniplasmid (MP) with the replication segment. Unfortunately, wider use of MC vectors is hampered by difficulties in isolating the target MCs from their MP counterpart. In this proof-of-concept study, a reproducible process is described to improve the purification of supercoiled (sc) MCs that combines an in vitro enzymatic relaxation of sc MP impurities with topoisomer separation and RNA clearance by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) step. At the early stage of vector design, a site for the nicking endonuclease Nb.BbvCI was strategically placed in the MP part of the PP backbone \u2026"

In this recombination event, one of the direct repeats and the intervening sequence were deleted or duplicated, originating monomeric or/and hetero-dimeric plasmid forms, respectively. Additionally, the plasmid rearrangement led to the acquisition of a kanamycin resistance phenotype. Recombination frequencies between 7.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 and 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 were determined for DH5\u03b1 and JM109(DE3) strains, respectively.

In this work, a systematic study of the stability of two model plasmids (3,697 and 6,050 bp) during a mid-scale production process, which includes fermentation, alkaline lysis, isopropanol and ammonium sulphate precipitation and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, was performed. Results indicate that by extending cell culture (up to 26 h) and cell lysis (up to 2 h) it is possible to significantly reduce the amounts of RNA, without significantly compromising the yields of the sc pDNA isoform, a feature that could be conveniently exploited for downstream processing purposes.

A decrease in the DOC from  was shown to increase the specific pDNA concentration approximately 1.5-fold, due to the downregulation of growth. Additionally, this increase in the pDNA concentration led to a 2.2-fold increase in the purity of cell lysates obtained after cell lysis. However, the use of higher DOC led to 2.8-fold higher volumetric productivity as a consequence of a faster growth rate, reducing the fermentation time from 24 to 8 h. Interestingly, the specific pDNA concentration, and pDNA productivity and purity were always higher  in the absence of antibiotic. Overall, the data indicate that nonselective conditions can be used without compromising yield, productivity, and purity of pDNA."

Although pulses with 1 V, lasting less than 1 ms and with a rise/fall times of 4.5 ns led to maximum hybridization of fully complementary strands, lack of stringency did not allow the discrimination of single base mismatches. However, by choosing pulse conditions that are slightly off the optimum, the selectivity for discriminating single base mismatches could be improved up to a factor \u223c5 when the mismatch was in the middle of the strand and up to \u223c1.5 when the mismatch was on the 5\u2032-end and.

Although it is possible to minimize plasmid degradation by decreasing temperature and reducing processing times, the presence of endogenous nucleases can be used advantageously to purify the plasmid streams. The kinetics of nucleic acid degradation showed that, by controlling the incubation at 37\u00b0C, it was possible to degrade RNA selectively, while maintaining plasmid integrity.

Modular cellulases contain non-catalytic type A carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that specifically bind to the crystalline regions of cellulose, thus promoting enzyme efficacy through proximity and targeting effects. Although type A CBMs play a critical role in cellulose recycling, their mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here we produced a library of recombinant CBMs representative of the known diversity of type A modules. The binding properties of 40 CBMs, in fusion with an N-terminal GFP domain, revealed that type A CBMs possess the ability to recognize different crystalline forms of cellulose and chitin over a wide range of temperatures, pH levels, and ionic strengths.

In spite of this specificity, cis-diol free species like proteins and genomic DNA (gDNA) are also removed. This is a major advantage since the process is designed to keep the target pDNA from binding. The focus of this paper is on the study of the secondary interactions between the impurities (RNA, gDNA, proteins, LPS) in a pDNA-containing lysate and 3-amino PB controlled pore glass (CPG) matrices.

A bootstrap resampling technique was used to estimate confidence intervals for the correlation parameters. More than 92% of the predicted values were found to be within a pre-established \u00b15-fold interval of deviation from experimental data. The correlation does not only provide a way to predict, with good accuracy, the recombination frequency, but also opens the way to improve insight into these processes."

The reaction kinetics is suggested to follow a Ping-Pong bi\u2013bi mechanism in which competitive inhibition by excess of alcohols has been identified. No evidence of any significant external diffusional limitation has been detected. The time validation of the model was successfully achieved simultaneously for 15 experimental product evolutions in a batch stirred tank reactor (BSTR) for different initial reactant concentrations."

In this contribution, we explore the enhancement effect of gold nanodimer antennas on the fluorescence of porphyrins in order to enable their single-molecule optical detection. Four meso-substituted free-base porphyrins were evaluated: two cationic, one neutral, and one anionic porphyrin. The gold nanodimer antennas are able to enhance the emission from these porphyrins by a factor of 105\u2013106 increase in the maximum detected photon rates. This extreme enhancement is due to the combination of an antenna effect on the excitation rate that is estimated to be above 104-fold and an emission efficiency that corresponds to an increase of 2\u201310 times in the porphyrin\u2019s fluorescence quantum yield."

Agarose gel electrophoresis was used as a first approach to evaluate qualitatively the amount of unbounded DNA by the liposomes.

The results show that the wicking and test time are comparable to those obtained with conventional nitrocellulose (NC)-based LFAs. Further, the cellulose paper provides an excellent background with no auto-fluorescence that is very adequate in detecting fluorescent lines. While fluorescence that was generated with cellulose strips was lower when compared to that generated in NC strips, signals could be improved by layering carbon nanofibers (CNF) on the cellulose. A nonlinear behavior of the concentration\u2013response relationship was observed for the LFA architectures with NC, cellulose, and cellulose-CNF in the 0 to 200 ng/mL cTnI concentration range. The measurements were consistent and characterized by coefficients of variation lower than 2.5%. Detection and quantitation limits that were in the range 1.28\u20131.40 ng/mL and 2.10\u20132.75 ng/mL were obtained for LFA with cellulose and cellulose CNF strips that are equivalent to the limits obtained with the standard NC LFA. Overall, we showed that commercially available filter paper can be used in the analytical strip of LFA."

The large-scale manufacturing of plasmid DNA (pDNA) vectors, and the downstream processing in particular, is one of the key aspects of process development required to move non-viral gene therapy to the clinic. To address the problematic isolation and purification of pDNA molecules, an alternative and cost effective process based on multimodal chromatography was developed. In particular, the possibility of using a cationic multimodal ligand (Capto\u2122 adhere) to remove RNA impurities from E. coli pre-purified lysates and to isolate supercoiled (sc) pDNA isoforms from open circular (oc) pDNA was explored. The process involves E. coli culture, cell harvesting and alkaline lysis followed by isopropanol, ammonium acetate and PEG-8000 precipitation. Finally, sc pDNA is isolated \u2026"

We observed an increase in pCIneo amplification (2.6\u20134.3-fold) in Escherichia coli cultures grown at 42 \u00b0C and also in minimal medium (at both 37 \u00b0C and 42 \u00b0C). These conditions fit to the smallest ratio between recombinant molecules and total plasmids. Conversely, increasing the dissolved oxygen tension from 20% to 40% in rich media did not have a significant impact on both plasmid copy number and recombination frequency, independently of the temperature used.We have also \u2026"

In top-gate EG-TFTs, the metal gate is replaced by an electrolyte solution, in which a biasing Pt electrode is immersed. It is possible to switch the TFT on by increasing the voltage of the Pt electrode above a threshold value (VT). EG-TFTs show a decrease in VT when the pH of the electrolyte solution is increased. EG-TFTs also show a shift in VT when exposed to solutions containing molecules of either DNA (VT decreases) or the protein horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (VT increases). Exposure to these solutions results in the adsorption of biomolecules at the dielectric-electrolyte interface which changes the TFT transfer curve and consequently allows electronic label-free detection of the biomolecules."

The microelectromechanical structure consists of a surface micromachined bilayer bridge of phosphorous-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon and aluminum. There is specific binding of DNA to hydroxylated bridge surfaces through silanization chemistry. Microbridges are electrostatically actuated and the resonance frequency measurements are performed in vacuum in the initial state after fabrication, after surface functionalization and after DNA immobilization. The sensor is able to detect the functionalization molecular layer and the DNA molecules attached to the surface through a shift in its resonance frequency."

A systematic study was undertaken in order to evaluate the possibility of scaling-up the process. The polymer was first characterized by determining the swelling ratio (or mass increase) in aqueous solution as a function of time, temperature, pH, salt and polymer concentration. The swelling ratio was found to be independent of the polymer concentration, temperature (range 15\u201350\u00b0 C), and pH (range 4\u201310), but decreased significantly with an increase in Nad concentration. The polymer was capable of absorbing as much as 300-times its own weight in water, when using the most favorable conditions (0 mM NaCl). BSA was concentrated up to 3.5-times when using the appropriate polymer concentration. The recovery of protein was around 100% for \u2026"

The top enhancement factors were above 1000-fold in 71% of the dimers within a total of 32 dimers measured, and in some cases, they reached almost 4000-fold, in good agreement with model simulations.

Candidates were constructed by cloning genes encoding the MVV gag polyprotein and gag proteins p16 and p25 fused to a \u03b2-galactosidase reporter in a plasmid backbone. Transfection of different ovine cells showed a higher protein expression with plasmid lacZp16, which was hence further optimised by (i) removing a putative inhibitory sequence via reduction of the AU-content in the p16 gene or by (ii) introducing a secretory signal (Sc) to promote antigen secretion and increase its presentation to APCs. Unexpectedly, plasmids constructed on the basis of the first strategy by mutagenesis of lacZp16 (lacZp16mut24), led to a reduction in the expression of the antigen/reporter fusion in cultured ovine cells. This indicates that the high AU content in MVV does not inhibit protein \u2026"

It has been shown that the two approaches give adequate descriptions of the experimental results. The models were used in order to estimate, respectively the parameter C, which is proportional to the reduction in hydrophobic exposed surface area upon adsorption, and the number of water and salt ions released upon adsorption. It was concluded that the magnitude of these parameters can be strongly influenced by the temperature, the hydrophobicity of the bases of the nucleotides, the molecular mass of the oligonucleotides and the presence of secondary structures. Parameter C was quantitatively related with the number of water molecules and salt \u2026"

This model is found to be equivalent to the plate model used to describe elution profiles in linear chromatography. Likewise, for a series with large number of units, the solutes elute from the system in the form of a Gaussian distribution. The analogy between this multistage ultrafiltration and column chromatography is further extended by defining and comparing parameters usually used to describe chromatographic separations such as resolution, capacity and selectivity. A case study is presented that compares the theoretical behaviour (elution profiles, resolution) of multistage ultrafiltration \u2026"

Among the different receptor types recognized today, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute, undoubtedly, one of the most important classes, in part due to their versatility, but particularly, due to their central role in a multitude of physiological states. The unveiling of GPCR function and mode of action is a challenging task that prevails until our days, as the full potential of these receptors is far from being established. Such an undertaking calls for a joint effort of multidisciplinary teams that must combine state-of-the-art technologies with in-depth knowledge of cell biology to probe such specialized molecules. This review provides a concise coverage of the scientific progress that has been made in GPCR \u2026"

Tight control of recombination is crucial to maximize minicircle yields and purity. In this work, a minicircle production system was constructed that relies on the enzymatic activity of ParA resolvase, a recombinase that is expressed under the transcription control of the arabinose inducible expression system pBAD/AraC, and on Escherichia coli BWAA, a strain improved for arabinose uptake. Undesired recombination already after 4 h of incubation in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 \u00b0C was observed due to the leaky expression from pBAD/AraC. While addition of glucose to the growth media repressed this leaky \u2026"

The \u03bcPAD is created by wax printing on a single piece of chromatographic paper and combined with an anti-D-dimer capture antibody and conjugates of anti-D-dimer antibody with 40 nm gold nanoparticles. The presence of D-dimer in buffer/simulated plasma samples is successfully reported for concentrations as low as 15 ng D-dimer/mL. Linearity between signal intensity and D-dimer concentration is observed up to 100 ng/mL. Using an appropriate dilution, the test could be used to yield positive results only for those samples with a D-dimer concentration above the clinically relevant threshold range of 250\u2013500 ng/mL. Finally, the merits and pitfalls of using \u03bcPADs as compared to lateral flow devices in immunoassays are discussed."

In order to improve the performance of minicircle production in Escherichia coli by ParA resolvase-mediated in vivo recombination, we focus on the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) of parA messenger RNA (mRNA). The arabinose-inducible PBAD/araC promoter controls ParA expression and strains with improved arabinose uptake are used. The 27-nucleotide-long 5\u2032-UTR of parA mRNA was optimized using a predictive thermodynamic model. An analysis of original and optimized mRNA subsequences predicted a decrease of 8.6\u201314.9 kcal/mol in the change in Gibbs free energy upon assembly of the 30S ribosome complex with the mRNA subsequences, indicating a more stable mRNA-rRNA complex and enabling a higher (48\u2013817-fold) translation initiation rate.

More specifically, the incorporation of many of the characteristics and properties found in natural materials into paints, coatings, films, concrete, glass, ceramics, fibers, and insulation has the potential to revolutionize the way infrastructures and buildings are constructed.

The influence of some of the relevant parameters to the enzyme alcoholysis activity, such as temperature, buffer molarity and pH of the enzyme solution, hexanol and butyl acetate concentrations, were studied by means of a factorial design plan. By knowing the system response to the experimental design, the effects of each factor and its interactions were determined. In the case of the preparations with NaY zeolite, the main effects are due to temperature and buffer molarity, while pH and hexanol concentration have little effect on activity. In case of the cutinase adsorbed on Accurel PA6 the main effects are due to temperature, buffer molarity and pH of the enzyme solution."

The method is specifically designed to prepare pDNA vectors for gene therapy and DNA vaccination applications. The method comprises alkaline lysis, concentration with iso-propanol, prepurification by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and purification by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), and desalting in gravity-operated 10-mL plastic columns. Analytical techniques used to control the performance of the method and to assess the quality of the pDNA vaccine are also described. Anion-exchange HPLC is used to determine pDNA concentration, whereas the presence of impurities such as RNA, proteins, E. coli genomic DNA, and endotoxins is determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, micro-bicinchoninic acid (BCA), real-time polymerase chain reaction and kinetic-quantitative chromogenic \u2026"

Ground state diffuse reflectance measurements were performed for the preparations previously equilibrated with salt solutions at well-defined optimum water activity. The corresponding cutinase fluorescence emission spectra were used to detect different conformational enzyme states, induced by different zeolite properties. Significant conformational changes were observed, with important consequences on the enzymatic activities."

In this work, thin-film amorphous silicon photodiodes with an integrated fluorescence filter were developed to capture the intracellular calcium dynamics in response to the activation of the endogenous muscarinic M1 GPCR of HEK 293T cells. Using the new device it was possible to characterize the potency of carbachol (EC50=10.5 \u00b5M) and pirenzepine (IC50=4.2 \u03bcM), with the same accuracy as standard microscopy optical systems.

Standards of gDNA and pDNA samples were sheared by sonication and adsorbed onto aminopropyl controlled pore glass (CPG) particles (130 \u03bcm). A preliminary study was conducted to optimize the amount of DNA adsorbed on the particles. Results indicated that maximum attachment efficiency was obtained by adsorbing DNA for 2 h in 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009SSC, pH 5.7. The DNA-bound particles were hybridized overnight with a 181-bp digoxigenin-labeled probe, specific for gDNA. Following a chemiluminescent detection protocol, signal intensities of the standards were plotted as a function of initial gDNA concentration. The calculated detection limit (LOD) was 1.4 pM of gDNA. The assay was able to detect gDNA in pure plasmid preparations at the 1% level even \u2026"

The enzyme (horseradish peroxidase) is used with two different substrates (luminol and tetramethylbenzidine) to produce chemiluminescent and light absorbent products, respectively. Sensitivities down to picomolar level (corresponding to 1 attomole of molecular labels in solution) have been obtained."

The effect of AOT concentration on the activity of penicillin acylase was also studied and an increase in the surfactant concentration, at a constant w0 was shown to produce an increase in enzyme activity. The influence of the water content (w0), AOT and enzyme concentration on the enzyme stability in reversed micelles was then investigated.Enzyme stabilisation by the addition of alcohols and sugars was examined and the sugar alcohol mannitol shown to provide an increase of more \u2026"

A medium modified with the ligand N-benzyl-N-methyl ethanolamine and an elution scheme with increasing NaCl concentration are used to accomplish the baseline separation of sc and oc plasmid. The utility of the method is demonstrated by quantitating topoisomers in a purified plasmid sample."

For substrate concentrations above 50 mg ml\u22121 a slight substrate inhibition was observed. Product inhibition was much stronger, and together with the decrease of the pH during the bioconversion was the most important limiting factor in long-term bioconversions.

These vectors are plasmid-derived circular DNA molecules that are obtained in vivo in Escherichia coli by the intramolecular recombination of a parental plasmid, which generates a minicircle containing the eukaryotic therapeutic cassette of interest and a miniplasmid containing the prokaryotic backbone. The production process results thus in a complex mixture, which hinders the isolation of minicircle molecules from other DNA molecules. Several strategies have been proposed over the years to meet the challenge of purifying and obtaining high quality minicircles in compliance with the regulatory guidelines for therapeutic use. In minicircle purification, the characteristics of the strain and parental plasmid used have a high impact and strongly affect the purification strategy that can be applied. This review summarizes the different methods developed so far, focusing not only on the purification method itself but also on its dependence on the upstream production strategy used."

Deregulation of protease metabolism can result in several pathological conditions (i.e., cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and others). Therefore, monitoring proteolytic activity in real time could have a fundamental role in the early diagnosis of these diseases. Herein, the main approaches used to develop biosensors for monitoring proteolytic activity are reviewed. A comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach is provided along with a discussion of their importance and promising opportunities for the early diagnosis of severe diseases. This new era of biosensors can be characterized by the ability to control and monitor biological processes, ultimately improving the potential of personalized medicine."

These differences in relative binding strength were explored using a stepwise elution strategy of decreasing buffer conductivities in order to increase the purity of supercoiled (SC) pDNA isoforms. The open circular (OC) isoforms of all plasmids eluted earlier at a similar conductivity of 190 mS/cm, independently of the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh).

We report measurements of streaming current in individual rectangular glass/PDMS microchannels with integrated miniaturized electrodes. Experiments performed using solutions with different salt concentrations and different electrode materials showed that the measured electrical current depends on the electrode material and in general differs from the real value of the streaming current. To determine the streaming current from the experimental data, an equivalent circuit model is proposed. The extracted value of the streaming current is proportional to the flow rate of electrolyte and the calculated glass/PDMS zeta potential scales \u2026"

Transposases of these ISs bind poorly to cognate DNA and comparative biophysical analyses of SC I and SC II have proven elusive. We have prepared a native, soluble, active, GFP-tagged fusion derivative of the IS2 transposase that creates fully formed complexes with single-end and minicircle junction (MCJ) substrates and used these successfully in hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments.

The carbon content of the thin film is varied by changing the amount of ethylene added to the ethylene/silane gas mixture during plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The optical properties of the films are characterised by transmittance measurements to obtain the refractive index, the optical bandgap, and the energy E04 of the films as a function of their carbon content. A set of filters that is appropriate for the detection of naturally fluorescent biomolecules is indicated. The system is used to demonstrate the detection of one of these naturally fluorescent biomolecules, the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)."

The plasmids were further engineered to carry antigen-targeting sequences, which promote protein transport to the extracellular space (secretion signal), lysosomes (LAMP-1) and to the endoplasmic reticulum (adenovirus e1a). Transfection efficiency was not affected by differences in the size between each construct as no differences in the plasmid copy number per cell were found.

The single-stranded immobilized DNA probes were either covalently immobilized (chemisorption) or electrostatically adsorbed (physisorption) to a chemically functionalized surface. Comparing the speed of electric field assisted immobilization and hybridization with the corresponding control reactions (without electric field), an increase of several orders of magnitude is observed, with the reaction timescaled down from 1 to 2 h to a range between 100 ns and 1 ms.

The low solubility of the dipeptide in the micellar solution led to the formation and growth of needle-like crystals during the synthesis as soon as supersaturation was achieved. The crystallization process then followed a typical pattern, proceeding in three phases: nucleation, de-supersaturation, and re-equilibrium of saturation. Crystallization was followed by visual observation with an optical microscope, and the increase of crystal number and size was confirmed. Experiments showed that the supersaturation concentration decreases with the addition of AcPheLeuNH2 seeds before the reaction, and also with a decrease of the stirring speed.

The use of 0.5 m NaCl in the loading buffer had a dramatic effect in the purity of IgG3 recovered in the flowthrough fraction (values in the order of 97% were consistently obtained). This was attributed to a more effective binding of IgG subclasses 1, 2 and 4 to protein A (well known classical mechanism based in Fc fragment) and in some extent to a decrease in the binding of subclass 3 to protein A by the alternative mechanism based in the Fab fragment. The increase in residence time also increased in a relevant way the purity of IgG3. This is attributed to an increased effectiveness of the mechanisms mentioned above. The \u2026"

Special interest has been focused on the effect of the concentration of the organic phase extractants and the pH of the aqueous phase on the extraction system. TOPO dissolved in isooctane enabled higher Kp values at lower concentrations to be attained and resulted in lower toxicity, but its extractive capacity is strongly dependent on the pH.

By using a tip-selective approach for thiol attachment of dye molecules onto gold nanorods, it was possible to effectively increase the emission by more than 10-fold relatively to that of a free dye. On the other hand, a non-selective approach revealed that indiscriminate surface functionalization has a detrimental effect on the enhancement. Simulations of discrete dipole approximation gave further insight into the surface distribution of plasmon-enhanced emission by confirming that tip regions afford an effective enhancement, while side regions exhibit a negligible effect or even emission quenching.

This feature was exemplified by selecting silver nanotriangle samples with spectral overlap with Atto-655 dye\u2019s absorption and emission in order to assemble dye-particle plasmophores. The emission brightness of an individual plasmophore, as characterized by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, is at least 1000-fold more intense than that of a single Atto-655 dye label, which renders them as promising platforms for the development of fluorescence-based nanosensors."

To investigate the potential effects of the pgi deletion/higher plasmid levels on recombinant human Interferon Gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production, a detailed network of the central metabolic pathway (100 metabolites, 114 reactions) of GALG20 and MG1655 was constructed. Elementary mode analysis (EMA) was then performed to compare the phenotypic spaces of both the strains and to check the effect of the pgi deletion on flux efficiency of each metabolic reaction. The results suggested that pgi deletion increases amino acid biosynthesis and flux efficiency towards IFN-\u03b3 synthesis by 11%. To further confirm the qualitative prediction that the pgi mutation favours recombinant human IFN-\u03b3\u202fexpression, GALG20 and MG1655 were lysogenised, transformed with \u2026"

The results presented in this study not only corroborate our previous observations that both the insertion sequence (IS) minicircle junction and target region adopt intrinsically bent conformations in IS2, but most interestingly, extend this requirement to other families of IS elements. Using this information, we were able to pinpoint regions with high propensity for transposition and to predict and detect, de novo, a novel IS2 insertion event in the 3\u2032 region of the gfp \u2026"

Attempts to increase the physical stability of highly purified supercoiled (SC) plasmid DNA in pharmaceutical aqueous solutions have relied on: (i) changing the DNA sequence, (ii) improving manufacturing to reduce deleterious impurities and initial DNA damage, and (iii) controlling the storage medium characteristics. In this work we analyzed the role of secondary structures on the degradation of plasmid molecules. Accelerated stability experiments were performed with SC, open circular (OC) and linear (L) isoforms of three plasmids which differed only in the \u201csingle-strandlike\u201d content of their polyadenylation (poly A) signals. We have proved that the presence of more altered or interrupted (non-B) DNA secondary structures did not directly translate into an easier strand scission of the SC isoforms. Rather, those unusual structures \u2026"

The transport of the ester substrates from the organic bulk to the water pool of the micelles was identified as the rate-limiting step. The amide nucleophilicity was found to decrease with an increase in hydrophobicity: Ser > Ala > Gly > Val > Ile > Leu.

Overall, more than 100 members have been included in the Adenoviridae family. This section will only give a brief description of the major characteristics of the adenovirus and its vectors because this topic has been covered in depth in several recent reviews [26\u201331].

The co-existence of the surfactant bounded minute water pools within the bulk organic solvent enables the simultaneous solubilization of the polar (IleNH2) and apolar (AcPheOEt) substrates, thus enabling the synthesis to take place at the micellar interface. The synthesis was favored by increasing the micellar interface via an increase in water content and surfactant concentration. The best dipeptide yield (87%) was obtained at 32\u2009\u00b0C, with the largest concentrations of TTAB (200 mM) and water (1100 mM) tested. The low solubility of the dipeptide in the micellar media further led to the formation and growth of needle-like crystals during synthesis, thus enabling the removal of product from solution."

This functionalization can deliver tailored cellulose-based materials with enhanced physical and chemical properties and control of biological interactions that match specific applications. One of the foundations for the success of such biomaterials is to efficiently control the capacity to combine relevant biomolecules into cellulose materials in such a way that the desired functionality is attained. In this context, our main goal was to develop bi-functional biomolecular constructs for the precise modification of cellulose hydrogels with bioactive molecules of interest. The main idea was to use biomolecular engineering techniques to generate and purify different recombinant fusions of carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) with significant biological entities. Specifically, CBM-based fusions were designed to enable the bridging of proteins or oligonucleotides with cellulose hydrogels. The work focused on constructs that combine a family 3 CBM derived from the cellulosomal-scaffolding protein A from Clostridium thermocellum (CBM3) with the following:(i) an N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) domain (GFP-CBM3);(ii) a double Z domain that recognizes IgG antibodies; and (iii) a C-terminal cysteine (CBM3C). The ability of the CBM fusions to bind and/or anchor their counterparts onto the surface of cellulose hydrogels was evaluated with pull-down assays. Capture of GFP-CBM3 by cellulose was first demonstrated qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy. The binding of the fusion proteins, the capture of antibodies (by ZZ-CBM3 \u2026"

The present industrial process uses a cobalt catalyst, dioxygen as oxidant, requires high temperatures (150 \u00b0C), being only able to reach 5\u201312% yields in order to assure a selectivity of approximately 85%. Thus, more efficient catalytic systems and milder reaction conditions are needed. Herein, an alternative catalytic system based on gold nanotriangles is presented. The search for sustainable catalytic oxidation processes remains a challenge. One process of utmost industrial and economic importance is the selective oxidation of cyclohexane, in the route of nylon-6,6 production, which requires urgent improvement. Herein, Au nanotriangles (Au NTs) were prepared following a three-step (seed preparation, growth and shaping) procedure and applied, for the first time, as catalysts for the selective oxidation of neat cyclohexane to ketone and alcohol (KA) oil (cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone mixture). The Au NTs successfully yield KA oil (up to 14%) under mild conditions (50 \u00b0C), using an alternative energy source (microwave irradiation) as reaction promotor."

In order to maintain genomic integrity, bacteria have developed a finely tuned and interwoven network of mechanisms that operate at multiple levels, including damage recognition, signalling pathways, and DNA repair. On the other hand, without the capacity to accommodate genotypic variation up to a certain extent, bacteria would not be able to modify their fitness when faced with constantly changing environments. Herein we review our current knowledge on bacterial genome instability, with particular emphasis on findings gained from the often-studied Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli. We will address topics such as spontaneous and stress-induced mutagenesis, major DNA repair pathways, and the design of more stable genomes. Major questions and future challenges will also be discussed."

The optimization of parameters, such as immobilization chemistry, hybridization time, and washing conditions, was first accomplished using a direct method based on the detection of fluorescein-labeled complementary targets. Under the optimized conditions, a methodology based on the post PicoGreen staining of the duplex molecules formed upon hybridization was demonstrated. This approach eliminates the requirements for pre-target labeling, while providing a rapid detection (less than 20 minutes) of specific complementary targets present in the solution."

The chemical composition and topography of the APTES layer are characterized using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), respectively. The effect of organic versus aqueous silanization media at different pH values, are compared. Micropatterning of the silanized layer is demonstrated and used to electrostatically immobilize single-stranded DNA probes, and to covalently immobilize thiolated single-stranded DNA probes after a cross-linking reaction with sulfo-EMCS. The hybridization efficiency of complementary DNA targets for both immobilization strategies is presented. The solid-phase DNA reactions were successfully demonstrated on surface squares of patterned functionalization layer, with \u2026"

Aminopropyl-controlled pore glass surface-bound oligonucleotides were hybridized to fragmented gDNA. The template-mediated extension at the 3\u2032-terminus of the immobilized probe was then promoted in the presence of Klenow I polymerase and digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides. Detection of the extended probes was accomplished with an anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate protocol coupled to colorimetric or fluorescent detection. Using the colorimetric protocol, the proof-of-concept was established. The fluorescence-based methodology, on the other hand, provided the basis for a quantitative interpretation of the data, affording a detection limit of 5 pM gDNA."

Consequently, the capacity to accurately and timely extract useful information from image and video data has become more and more important. Image J is an open-source program that provides powerful tools with a simple interface designed to fit the needs of image analysis of most researchers. In this chapter, Image J routines to extract information from individual cells in a calcium GPCR assay are described. In these routines, individual cells in the same image/video data can be separated using either a progressive threshold or a local threshold method. Both methods can be optimized to either a maximum number of selection or maximum area selected resulting in conceptually distinct selections."

The identification of drugs that target GPCRs usually relies on functional, cell-based assays. Here, the binding of a test compound to a receptor alters the conformation of the associated G-protein, initiating a cascade of events. The magnitude of the response is typically measured by monitoring key elements in the cascade (e.g., calcium) with fluorescent dyes or with luminescent reporter proteins (e.g., aequorin). The goal of this project is to develop cell microchips for the screening of drugs that act upon GPCRs. The basic unit of the chip will be composed of: i) 15\u2013100 micron-sized test sites where the cells are placed and contacted with the candidate drug via a microfluidic network, and ii) independent, micron-sized amorphous \u2026"

Covalent bonding occurs with only 100 ns of pulse duration, representing a 10 order of magnitude decrease in immobilization time from the 2 hours needed without electric field. The probes immobilized using this technique were successfully hybridized with a complementary DNA strand. This confirmed that the probe molecules were correctly oriented and were not damaged during the immobilization process. The duration and voltage level of the pulse used are compatible with silicon microelectronics circuits."

AcPheLeuNH2 solubility in reversed micellar solutions was examined, revealing that a decrease in TTAB concentration, water to surfactant ratio (Wao) and octanol concentration in the organic mixture led to a decrease in solubility. In contrast, no significant influence of buffer molarity and pH was detected. These results were explained by suggesting that the main environment for the solubilization of the dipeptide molecules is the micellar interface rather than the bulk organic phase or the micellar water pool. The synthesis of AcPheLeuNH2 was then carried out using those process conditions that led to the lower solubility values \u2026"

Single square and sinusoidal voltage pulses with amplitudes between 0.1 and 5 V and durations between 20 ns and 10 ms are used to achieve specific DNA oligonucleotide probe covalent immobilization to a functionalized surface and complementary DNA oligonucleotide hybridization to an immobilized DNA probe. Square voltage pulses are shown to be more effective for DNA immobilization and sinusoidal pulses for DNA hybridization. The electrode configuration allows controlling the spatial confinement of this electric-field effect."

These electrodes were scaled down to 20 \u03bcm. Photolithography was used to define the electrode voltage line, ground line, and functionalized thin-film area on a plastic substrate (polyimide). At all electrode dimensions, electric field-assisted DNA immobilization and hybridization can be achieved in the microsecond time scale, far faster than the 2 hr or 16 hr needed for immobilization and hybridization, respectively, without the electric field. Pulse conditions optimized with the large-size electrodes (2 mm) were used in the microelectrodes."

Most often, NAs are isolated and purified merely as a way of obtaining quantitative and qualitative information about a certain sample (eg paternity testing, screening for viruses in clinical samples, etc.). Several purification methods have been developed by laboratories and companies involved in the above-mentioned areas. These protocols and processes are based on the same general principles, and follow three main stages: obtaining the NA source (cell growth, tissue isolation, chemical or enzymatic reaction), primary isolation and purification. Different techniques exist that can be used alone or in combination within each step of the isolation/purification scheme (Figure 1). When choosing an isolation/purification protocol or process, NA researchers and manufacturers should take into account several aspects. Especially important are the nature of the target NA, the final application, cost and availability of the technique (Table 1). The final application will determine which specifications (yield, purity, safety, efficacy, identity) the final NA preparation should follow."

The productivity of a bioconversion can be maximized if it is carried out in the presence of substrate/product concentrations at which the biocatalyst shows optimal activity and stability. One way to achieve this is to develop a process with continuous addition of the substrate and selective removal of the product. The microbial oxidation of isoamyl alcohol to isovaleraldehyde by a newly isolated Gluconobacter oxydans strain has been reported recently. High conversion yields (> 90%) and good rates (maximum yield after 90 min) were obtained in a batch mode. With this strain, although aldehyde dehydrogenase (s) leading to acid formation are present, further oxidation of the aldehyde to acid is significantly slower so that transient accumulation of the aldehyde is possible. The productivity of this bioconversion can be improved by setting up a continuous process with addition of substrate at an adequate flow rate. In situ removal of the aldehyde is imperative to avoid acid production and to reduce evaporation of the product. This chapter describes a membrane-based extractive procedure to achieve an in situ, nondispersive recovery of the aldehyde."

After solid liquid separation, a high-cut precipitation is performed by bringing isopropanol concentration to 70% v/v to precipitate pDNA. Tests made with lysates show that the differential precipitation increases purity threefold compared to the conventional one-step precipitation at 70% v/v without affecting pDNA recovery (>80%)."

DNA immunization has been shown to be an efficient way of generating antibodies, activating T helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, conferring protection against a wide range of infectious and non-infectious diseases. When compared with traditional vaccines, DNA vaccine technology is associated with simple and cost effective production protocols. The increase of the immunogenicity and potency of DNA vaccines is a necessary step for their successful application in larger animals and humans. A new generation of vaccines is being tested in ongoing clinical trials, using more efficient delivery devices and formulations. These efforts have resulted in the licensing of four DNA products for veterinary diseases which constitutes a huge step forward for the establishment of this immunization concept. In this chapter the molecular and cellular mechanisms of DNA vaccines will be addressed, as well as the optimization strategies that are currently pursued to harness the therapeutic and commercial advantages of DNA vaccination."

Available drug regimens are very limited and highly toxic so the development of a vaccine would be extremely advantageous. Since the parasite has the ability of misleading the immune response through antigenic variation of its surface coat the development of vaccine was thought to be highly unlikely. However research focused on the identification of invariant components to be used as therapeutic targets and the evolution of DNA vaccine technology bring this objective into the realms of possibility.Ten DNA vaccine prototypes were constructed encoding ISG (invariant surface glycoprotein) and TSA (trans-sialidase) genes from Trypanosoma brucei. These were linked to different targeting sequences to direct the protein to the major antigen processing pathways:(1) LAMP-1 signal targets the \u2026"

Two major effects of the encapsulation of the lipase in the micelles were observed: greater stability, at pH 7 and 8, and higher resistance to thermal deactivation. The stability of the lipase was strongly affected by the pH, especially in reversed micelles. The lipase in organic media was also used in a continuous reversed micellar membrane reactor for over a week without significant loss of activity."

Traditional optimisation methods rely on classic Design of Experiments (DoE) methods, which are time\u2010consuming and can present human bias or based on simplified assumptions. In this contribution, we propose the use of Machine Learning approaches to perform a data\u2010driven optimization of an mRNA IVT reaction. A Bayesian optimization method and model interpretability techniques were used to automate \u2026"

The top enhancement factors were above 1000-fold in 71% of the dimers within a total of 32 dimers measured, and, in some cases, they reached almost 4000-fold, in good agreement with model simulations. Additionally, fluorescence lifetime correlation analysis enabled the separation of enhanced from non-enhanced emission simultaneously collected in our confocal detection volume. This approach allowed us to recover a short relaxation component exclusive to enhanced emission that is attributed to the interaction of the dye with DNA in the interparticle gaps."

Unfortunately, wider use of MC vectors is hampered by difficulties in isolating the target MCs from their MP counterpart. In this proof-of-concept study, a reproducible process is described to improve the purification of supercoiled (sc) MCs that combines an in vitro enzymatic relaxation of sc MP impurities with topoisomer separation and RNA clearance by multimodal chromatography."

                "abstract": "The possibility of using plasmids as biopharmaceuticals for gene therapy and DNA vaccination has gradually emerged during the past 20 years (1). The plasmid DNA (pDNA) molecules in these biopharmaceuticals should transfer genes to target individuals (humans and animals) to prevent or exercise control over diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and cancer. A significant challenge in this context is the development of manufacturing processes capable of producing the required material to run pre-clinical and clinical trials (1, 2).The manufacturing of pDNA comprises a series of interlinked activities (see Figure 1) designed to consistently obtain a defined amount of a safe and effective product (1). The pDNA is typically produced by replication in Gram-negative Escherichia coli. However, in most cases, the strains used (eg, DH5 \u03b1, JM101, BL21) were originally developed for cloning or for the production of recombinant proteins (1). Due to their miscellaneous mutagenized genetic backgrounds, such strains may thus not be the best choice for producing the large amounts of pDNA required for clinical trials and eventual commercialization (3, 4). A more rational approach is to start from a wild-type strain and select/mutate genes that are likely to have an impact on the kinetics of cell growth and on the synthesis of pDNA (5, 6). Such engineered strains should grow up to high cell densities and produce large quantities of pDNA (ie, maximize volumetric pDNA yield, mg pDNA/L) as quickly as possible and at the lowest cost. Although the growth/production medium, bioreactor operating variables, and culture strategies are key aspects at this stage, starting \u2026"

                "abstract": "The use of minicircles in gene therapy applications is dependent on the availability of high-producer cell systems. In order to improve the performance of minicircle production in Escherichia coli by ParA resolvase-mediated in vivo recombination, we focus on the 5\u00e2  \u00b2 untranslated region (5\u00e2  \u00b2-UTR) of parA messenger RNA (mRNA). The arabinose-inducible PBAD/araC promoter controls ParA expression and strains with improved arabinose uptake are used. The 27-nucleotide-long 5\u00e2  \u00b2-UTR of parA mRNA was optimized using a predictive thermodynamic model. An analysis of original and optimized mRNA subsequences predicted a decrease of 8.6\u00e2    14.9\u00c2 kcal/mol in the change in Gibbs free energy upon assembly of the 30S ribosome complex with the mRNA subsequences, indicating a more stable mRNA-rRNA complex and enabling a higher (48\u00e2    817-fold) translation initiation rate. No effect of the 5\u00e2  \u00b2-UTR was detected when ParA was expressed from a low-copy number plasmid (\u00e2  \u00bc14 copies/cell), with full recombination obtained within 2\u00c2 h. However, when the parA gene was inserted in the bacterial chromosome, a faster and more effective recombination was obtained with the optimized 5\u00e2  \u00b2-UTR. Interestingly, the amount of this transcript was 2.6\u00e2    3-fold higher when compared with the transcript generated from the original sequence, highlighting that 5\u00e2  \u00b2-UTR affects the level of the transcript. A Western blot analysis confirmed that E. coli synthesized higher amounts of ParA with the new 5\u00e2  \u00b2-UTR (\u00e2  \u00bc1.8\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b1\u00c2 0.7-fold). Overall, these results show that the improvements made in the 5\u00e2  \u00b2-UTR can lead to a more efficient translation \u2026"

The DNA vaccines could be the answer for this disease by being able to induce production of IgG antibodies and induce of Th1/Th2 cytokines mediated by CD8+ T cells and activating CD4+ T helper cells. In this study, we shows that Balb-C mice immunized intramuscularly with a single dose of plasmids encoding three antigenic candidate genes from Trypanosoma brucei, named Invariant Surface Glycoprotein (ISG), trans-sialidase (TSA), and fosfolipase C (PLC) are able to produce IgG antibodies antiotrypanosoma.

Surface-adsorbed HRP can be detected with a limit of 1 fmol.cm-2 by both detection methods. Immunoassays were performed using HRP-labeled antibodies and the detection of specific antibody-antigen molecular recognition is demonstrated both in the plastic well and inside a microfluidic channel. The application of the a-Si:H/HRP system is extended by coupling HRP with oxidase enzyme systems for glucose detection and a sensitivity of 0.1 mmol/L was achieved."

Miniaturization of immunoassays is achieved using microfluidics coupled with integrated optical detection of the antibody-antigen molecular recognition reaction using thin-film amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) photodiodes. The detection system used consists of an a-Si:H photodiode aligned with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel. An enzymatic reaction taking place in the microchannel yields a product which is a light-absorbent molecule and hence can be optically detected by the integrated photodiode. Specific antigen-antibody reaction was detected and distinguished from the non-specific reaction."

Compared to diffusion-based surface reactions (in the absence of the applied electric field), an improvement of several orders of magnitude in the kinetics of the immobilization and hybridization reactions is observed with low amplitude (below 2 V) and short duration (100 ns to 1 ms) voltage pulses. E-assisted DNA reactions are demonstrated using mm-size macroelectrodes and then optimized using \u03bcm-size microelectrodes."

                "abstract": "BackgroundDetermination of the plasmid content in prokaryotic cells during plasmid DNA (pDNA) production and in eukaryotic cells after transfection is crucial for DNA vaccine development. In Escherichia coli, pDNA is usually determined after plasmid extraction, either by UV absorbance or by densitometry of ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Fluorescence microscopy techniques are mainly used in eukaryotic cells. These techniques are time-consuming and labour-intensive and can not be used for process control. Thus, a Real-Time PCR method was developed to monitor the plasmid content of E. coli and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.ResultsReal-Time PCR with a 108 bp amplicon enabled the detection of quantities as low as 4 copies of pDNA per cell in E. coli and 100 copies/cell in CHO cells transfected with high copy-number plasmids (see figure 1). The procedure can be performed in less than 30 minutes and requires no sample pre-treatment. Analysis of pDNA number in E. coli harbouring a ColE1 plasmid revealed that copy number reached a maximum during exponential phase of growth and that this number decreased up to 80% upon entry into stationary phase. Additionally, the half-life of pDNA in transfected CHO cells was 20 hours and around 100 copies of plasmid were still detected 6 days after transfection."

When the operating medium changes from vacuum to air, a small decrease of 5% of the resonance frequency occurs and the quality factor decreases from approximately 1000 to 100. The operation of the microresonators in deionized water produces a 60% shift in resonance frequency to lower values and the quality factor decreases to 10. Appropriate actuation conditions at resonance in water are used to avoid electrolysis and electrode field screening. The detection of the resonance frequency of a microbridge operating in solutions with high conductivities, up to 8 mS/cm, and viscosities up to 0.2 Pa.s is demonstrated."

Device characteristics are compared with structurally equivalent top-gate a-Si:H TFTs. The EG devices show higher mobility and smaller subthreshold slope than their counterparts with metal gate and work in a narrower voltage range. EG-TFTs show chemical sensitivity, illustrated by a voltage shift in the transfer curve as a consequence of pH variation. The sensitivity of the devices to p H is different depending on whether the top layer in contact with the electrolyte is SiO2 or SiNx."

The emitted light is then converted into an electrical signal in the photodetector, thus allowing the detection of the presence of the tagged DNA molecules. The design, fabrication and characterization of this integrated a-Si:H-based bio-detector is described. The detection limit of the present device is of the order of 20 pmol/cm2.

The first sections review the basic concepts, classification, advantages and problems associated with enzymatic membrane reactors. Different applications that have been described in the scientific literature in the last 20 years are then presented and discussed.

A comparison of HIBA mass transfer experiments was carried out in the membrane reactor with two and three phases for different pH and TOPO concentrations. The use of the three-phase arrangement allows the extraction of high quantities of HIBA from the aqueous medium (higher than 85%) independently of the pH, whereas in the two-phase system the percentage of HIBA extracted from the aqueous medium was lower, 42% in the best \u2026"

TOPO dissolved in isooctane enabled higher K (p) values at lower concentrations to be attained and resulted in lower toxicity, but its extractive capacity is strongly dependent on the pH.

A two-liquid-phase system, composed of water and isooctane (v/v, 1/1), was particularly suited for a significant accumulation of the aldehyde: Acetobacter sp. ALEG furnished 9 g/l of phenylacetaldehyde within 4 h starting from 10 g/l of alcohol and still 8 g/l were recovered after 24 h in the organic phase, whereas strain ALEF gave 3.5 g/l of aldehyde from 5.0 g/l of substrate.

Particularly, the presence in pDNA of direct repeats, inverted repeats or hotspots for the insertion of mobile elements are often responsible for the formation of structurally aberrant forms, thus threatening its clinical application. Moreover, the low frequency of some of these events often impairs its own detection.In the recent years some authors have found practical evidences for structural instability phenomena occurring spontaneously in plasmids used for DNA vaccination (reviewed by Oliveira et al., 2009). These include direct-repeat mediated deletion-formation events in the vector pCIneo (Ribeiro et al., 2008) or IS1-mediated instability in a vaccine against HIV (Prather et al., 2006)."

In non-spherical particles, large fluorescence enhancements are obtained in surface regions where large near fields, or plasmon hot-spots, occur. Typically, these hot-spots are located in regions of large curvature, eg at the tips of gold nanorods (Figure 1A). In this contribution, colloidal gold nanorods were functionalized with dye-labeled oligos to optimize antenna effects for fluorescence signal enhancement.

Two important small families of proteins play a role in these regulation mechanisms: the \u03b2-arrestins and the GPCR kinases (GRKs). Like heterotrimeric G-proteins, \u03b2-arrestins and GRKs will interact virtually with every GPCR whenever a stimulus is applied. Upon GPCR activation, the second messenger molecules are recognised by GRKs, leading to the phosphorylation of some regions of the GPCR such as the carboxyl terminus. This phosphorylation will not only prevent the association of the GPCR with the G-protein as it will also trigger the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestins. These proteins contribute to the regulation by steric exclusion and are also recognised by clathrin coated pit forming elements (eg adapter protein 2 (AP2), clathrin and dynamin), leading to the internalisation of the receptor. The \u03b2-arrestin molecule is constitutively phosphorylated in the cytosol and is dephosphorylated upon GPCR internalisation. The ubiquitination of the \u03b2-arrestin sets both proteins for degradation (Figure 3, page 60) 5, 8-10."

Al\u00e9m disso, a separa\u00e7\u00e3o de mol\u00e9culas com caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas muito semelhantes, como \u00e9 o caso de minic\u00edrculos, de miniplasm\u00eddeos e plasm\u00eddeos parentais n\u00e3o recombinados, \u00e9 muito problem\u00e1tica sendo os m\u00e9todos actualmente dispon\u00edveis baseados em estrat\u00e9gias complexas que incluem processos de afinidade [6] ou reagentes t\u00f3xicos [5]. Claramente, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio desenvolver novos m\u00e9todos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e purifica\u00e7\u00e3o para que a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o cl\u00ednica de minic\u00edrculos se possa tornar uma realidade.No nosso laborat\u00f3rio estamos a desenvolver um sistema robusto e escal\u00e1vel para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de grandes quantidades de MCs. O plasm\u00eddeo parental modelo foi constru\u00eddo de modo a gerar MCs capazes de expressar a prote\u00edna rep\u00f3rter GFP, que permite avaliar a efici\u00eancia de transfec\u00e7\u00e3o em diferentes linhas de c\u00e9lulas animais.

Paperbased analytical devices have emerged as one of such platforms, with the additional advantages of being biodegradable, easy-to-use and portable [1]. Paper can be modified and adapted to perform biological assays by adding appropriate biorecognition and reporting agents (eg antibodies, enzymes, oligonucleotides and DNA aptamers) to the test areas [2]. Additionally, paper surfaces can be modified with metal nanoparticles (eg Au, Ag, and Cu, among others) to introduce optical and electronic properties better suited for biosensing applications [3, 4]. One of the keys for the success of these paper surfaces is the ability to master the immobilization of biomolecules and metal nanoparticles, while adequately preserving functionality and stability.Covalent attachment to the cellulose fibers is not a strict requirement for the incorporation of either biomolecules or metal nanoparticles into paper. In fact, dry paper itself is able to sorb aqueous solutions in such a way that the non-volatile components of the solutions are left in the paper structure after drying. However, impregnation without attachment may not be a robust strategy to immobilize biomolecules or metal nanoparticles because subsequent exposure to aqueous solutions (eg washing buffers or biological samples) is likely to leach these components. Furthermore, it is difficult to control the orientation of biomolecules in the paper structure, especially in the case of antibodies, with recognition sites \u2026"

This operation is usually used in the beginning of the downstream processing, replacing several unit operations and leading to higher yields and lower process times. The application and optimization of this technique was studied for the purification of an enzyme at laboratory scale followed by scale-up to pilot, constantly intending yield maximization. System hydrodynamics were studied to better understand its behavior at different bed heights and viscosities. Resin-biomass interaction was found to be problematic, causing fouling and absorbent aggregation that affects fluid distribution and bed expansion, leading to a reduction in performance. This aggregation was especially observed when old broth was loaded, which suggests that broth aging has a strong influence in this interaction, possibly due to its enrichment in free nucleic acids with time that will bind to the adsorbent; furthermore, DNA adsorption was confirmed by fluorescence. Both settled bed height and expansion factor were kept constant during scale-up and promising yields were achieved."

A study of the long-term effects of shRNA expression in the livers of adult mice strikes a note of caution, however. It turns out that many shRNAs are toxic when expressed in mice. The toxicity \u2014 often fatal \u2014 seems to result from competition between shRNAs and endogenous microRNAs for binding to exportin-5, a factor involved in transporting molecules out of the nucleus.

Cotransfection of cells with pDG and an AAV vector plasmid was sufficient for production of infectious rAAV, resulting in helper virus-free rAAV stocks.

In reality, however, their use in patients is restricted by prevalent anti-AAV immunity or by their inadequate performance in specific targets, exemplified by the AAV type 2 (AAV-2) prototype in the liver. Here, we attempted to merge desirable qualities of multiple natural AAV isolates by an adapted DNA family shuffling technology to create a complex library of hybrid capsids from eight different wild-type viruses. Selection on primary or transformed human hepatocytes yielded pools of hybrids from five of the starting serotypes: 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. More stringent selection with pooled human antisera (intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG]) then led to the selection of a single type 2/type 8/type 9 chimera, AAV-DJ, distinguished from its closest natural relative \u2026"

While this is believed to be in part due to its ability to uncoat more readily than other AAV serotypes such as AAV2, understanding all the processes behind AAV8 transduction is important for its application and optimal use in human gene therapy. Here, we provide the first report of a cellular receptor for AAV8, the 37/67-kDa laminin receptor (LamR). We document binding of LamR to AAV8 capsid proteins and intact virions in vitro and demonstrate its contribution to AAV8 transduction of cultured cells and mouse liver in vivo. We also show that LamR plays a role in transduction by three other closely related serotypes (AAV2, -3, and -9). Sequence and deletion analysis allowed us to map LamR binding to two protein subdomains predicted to be \u2026"

These new data suggest that liver progenitor cells do not function solely as a backup system in chronic liver injury; rather, they also produce hepatocytes after acute injury and are in fact the main source of new hepatocytes during normal hepatocyte turnover. In addition, other evidence suggests that hepatocytes are capable of lineage conversion, acting as precursors of biliary epithelial cells during biliary injury. To test these concepts, we generated a hepatocyte fate-tracing model based on timed and specific Cre recombinase expression and marker gene activation in all hepatocytes of adult Rosa26 reporter mice with an adenoassociated viral vector.

So far, all these studies have provided evidence that AAV-2 vectors possess many properties making them very attractive for therapeutic gene delivery to humans, such as a lack of pathogenicity or toxicity, and the ability to confer long-term gene expression. However, there is concern that two restrictions of AAV-2 vectors might limit their clinical use in humans. First, these vectors are rather inefficient at transducing some cells of therapeutic interest, such as liver and muscle cells. Second, gene transfer might be hampered by neutralizing anti-AAV-2 antibodies, which are highly prevalent in the human population.

Here we show that the Rep52 and Rep40 proteins of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) are required to translocate capsid-associated, single-stranded DNA genomes into preformed empty AAV-2 capsids, and that the DNA helicase function of Rep52/40 is essential for this process. Furthermore, DNase protection experiments suggest that insertion of AAV-2 genomes proceeds from the 3\u2032 end, which correlates with the 3\u2032\u2192 5\u2032 processivity demonstrated for the Rep52/40 helicase. A model is proposed in which capsid-immobilized helicase complexes act as molecular motors to \u2018pump\u2019single-stranded DNA across the capsid boundary."

During an intermediate stage, they also appeared at an interior part of the nucleolus for a short period, whereas most of the time the nucleoli were Rep negative.

Small RNA-based mechanisms such as RNA interference (RNAi) have been shown in plant and invertebrate systems to play a key role in host responses to viral infection. Although homologs of the key RNAi effector pathways are present in mammalian cells, and can launch an RNAi-mediated degradation of experimentally targeted mRNAs, any role for such responses in mammalian host-virus interactions remains to be characterized. Six different viruses were examined in 41 experimentally susceptible and resistant host systems. We identified virus-derived small RNAs (vsRNAs) from all six viruses, with total abundance varying from \u201cvanishingly rare\u201d (less than 0.1% of cellular small RNA) to highly abundant (comparable to abundant micro-RNAs \u201cmiRNAs\u201d). In addition to the appearance of vsRNAs during infection, we saw a number of specific changes in host miRNA profiles. For several infection models investigated in more detail, the RNAi and Interferon pathways modulated the abundance of vsRNAs. We also found evidence for populations of vsRNAs that exist as duplexed siRNAs with zero to three nucleotide 3\u2032 overhangs. Using populations of cells carrying a Hepatitis C replicon, we observed strand-selective loading of siRNAs onto Argonaute complexes. These experiments define vsRNAs as one possible component of the interplay between animal viruses and their hosts."

Beyond neurohormonal and myocyte signaling pathways, growing evidence suggests inflammatory signaling pathways as therapeutically targetable contributors to this process. We recently reported that microRNA-155 is a key mediator of cardiac inflammation and injury in infectious myocarditis. Here, we investigated the impact of microRNA-155 manipulation in hypertensive heart disease.Genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of the leukocyte-expressed microRNA-155 in mice markedly reduced cardiac inflammation, hypertrophy, and dysfunction on pressure overload. These alterations were macrophage dependent because in vivo cardiomyocyte-specific microRNA-155 manipulation did not affect cardiac hypertrophy or dysfunction \u2026"

Numerous studies document RNAi efficacy in laboratory animals, and the first clinical trials are underway and thus far suggest that RNAi is safe to use in humans. Yet substantial hurdles have also surfaced and must be surmounted before therapeutic RNAi applications can become a standard therapy. Here we review the most critical roadblocks and concerns for clinical RNAi transition, delivery, and safety. We highlight emerging solutions and concurrently discuss novel therapeutic RNAi-based concepts. The current rapid advances create realistic optimism that the establishment of RNAi as a new and potent clinical modality in humans is near."

Titration of a variety of recombinant AAV-2 (rAAV) preparations revealed that at least 80% of all particles were empty, compared with a maximum of 50% in wild-type AAV-2 stocks, indicating that the recombinant genomes were less efficiently encapsidated. This finding was confirmed upon titration of CsCl gradient fractions from recombinant and wild-type AAV-2 stocks. ELISA-based measurement of capsid numbers revealed a large number of physical particles with low densities corresponding to empty capsids in the recombinant, but not in the wild-type AAV-2 preparations. Moreover, additional expression of VP proteins during rAAV production was found to result in an excessive capsid formation \u2026"

The production and purification of high-titer rAAV vector stocks for experimental and therapeutic          gene transfer continue to undergo improvement. Standard rAAV vector purification protocols include the purification of the vector by cesium chloride (CsCl)-density gradient centrifugation followed by extensive          desalination via dialysis against a physiological buffer for in vivo use. These procedures are extremely time consuming and frequently result in a substantial loss of the infectious vector titer. As an          alternative to CsCl we have investigated the use of Iodixanol, an X-ray contrast solution, as the density-gradient medium. Purification of rAAV vectors by Iodixanol shortened the centrifugation period to          3 hr and resulted in reproducible concentration and purification of rAAV-vector stocks. We show \u2026"

Such mutations can be corrected by skipping exon 51, thereby restoring the dystrophin reading frame. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), we generated a DMD mouse model by deleting exon 50. These \u0394Ex50 mice displayed severe muscle dysfunction, which was corrected by systemic delivery of adeno-associated virus encoding CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing components.

Using this approach, we demonstrate here the ability to achieve specific, non-toxic, and persistent knockdown of fatty acid transport protein 5 in mouse livers from a single adeno-associated virus injection, resulting in a marked reduction of hepatic dietary fatty acid uptake, reduced caloric uptake, and concomitant protection from diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Numerous pre-clinical studies are evaluating RNAi as a novel therapeutic modality in the battle against gain-of-function autosomal dominant diseases, cancer, and viral infections. One emerging concern is that RNAi mono-therapies might ultimately fail to control viruses that can escape silencing by mutation and/or RNAi suppression. Thus, sophisticated strategies are being developed that aim to avert viral resistance by combining RNAi effectors with each other or with further gene expression inhibitors. Several reports already validate this new concept of \u201ccombinatorial RNAi\u201d (coRNAi) and illustrate its versatility by describing co-expression of RNAi triggers directed against single or multiple, viral or cellular, targets.

However, potential therapeutic applications need to consider the predominant transduction of the liver once AAV-2 vectors enter the systemic circulation. We therefore aimed to increase efficiency and specificity of cardiac vector delivery by combining transcriptional and cell surface targeting. Methods For analysis of transcriptional targeting, recombinant AAV vectors were generated harboring a luciferase reporter gene under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter or the 1.5-kb cardiac myosin light chain promoter fused to the CMV immediate-early enhancer (CMVenh/MLC1.5). Luciferase activities were determined in representative organs three weeks after intravenous injection of the vector into adult mice. Transductional targeting was studied using luciferase \u2026"

Here we studied whether liver transduction could be further enhanced by using viral DNA packaging sequences (inverted terminal repeats [ITRs]) derived from AAV genotypes other than 2. To this end, we generated two sets of vector constructs carrying expression cassettes embedding a gfp gene or the human factor IX (hfIX) gene flanked by ITRs from AAV genotypes 1 through 6. Initial in vitro analyses of gfp vector DNA replication, encapsidation, and cell transduction revealed a surprisingly high degree of interchangeability among the six genotypes. For subsequent in vivo studies, we cross-packaged the six hfIX variants into AAV-8 and infused mice via the portal vein with doses of 5 \u00d7 1010 to 1.8 \u00d7 1012 particles. Notably, all vectors \u2026"

Such individuals are at a high risk of developing acute or chronic hepatic disease, and ultimately dying from sequelae. Although a vaccine is available for hepatitis A and B virus, treatment options for chronically infected patients are limited, and particularly ineffective in case of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A promising new avenue currently being explored is to harness the power of RNA interference for development of an antiviral therapy. The timing to pursue this particular approach is excellent, with the first in vivo animal models for HCV infection becoming available, and the technology for liver-specific expression of short hairpin RNAs advancing at a rapid pace. Here, we critically review these important current developments, and discuss the next steps to bring this novel approach into the clinics."

A large part of its attraction stems from the ease with which the viral capsid can be engineered for particle retargeting to cell types of choice, evasion from neutralizing antibodies or other desirable properties. Particularly powerful and in the focus of the current review are high-throughput methods aimed at expanding the repertoire of AAV vectors by means of directed molecular evolution, such as random mutagenesis, DNA family shuffling, in silico reconstruction of ancestral capsids, or peptide display. Here, unlike the wealth of prior reviews on this topic, we especially emphasize and critically discuss the practical aspects of the different procedures \u2026"

To further unravel the mechanisms behind AAV8 transduction, we used yeast two-hybrid analyses to screen a mouse liver complementary DNA library for cellular proteins capable of interacting with the viral capsid proteins. In total, we recovered approximately 700 clones, comprising over 300 independent genes. Sequence analyses revealed multiple hits for over 100 genes, including two encoding the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L. Notably, these two proteases also physically interacted with the corresponding portion of the AAV2 capsid in yeast, but not with AAV5. We demonstrate that cathepsins \u2026"

Initially, collagen produced by myofibroblasts (MFs) functions to maintain the integrity of the liver, but excessive collagen accumulation suppresses residual hepatocyte function, leading to liver failure. As a strategy to generate new hepatocytes and limit collagen deposition in the chronically injured liver, we developed in vivo reprogramming of MFs into hepatocytes using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing hepatic transcription factors. We first identified the AAV6 capsid as effective in transducing MFs in a mouse model of liver fibrosis. We then showed in lineage-tracing mice that AAV6 vector-mediated in vivo hepatic reprogramming of MFs generates hepatocytes that replicate function and proliferation of primary hepatocytes, and reduces liver fibrosis.

Nonetheless, it has also become evident that the current generation of AAV vectors will require improvements in transduction potency, antibody evasion, and cell specificity in order to realize their full potential and to widen applicability in larger patient cohorts. Fortunately, in the recent past, the field has seen a flurry of exciting new developments that enhance our understanding of AAV vector biology, including virus\u2013host interactions, and/or that expand our arsenal of technologies for AAV capsid design and evolution. This review highlights a collection of latest advances in these areas, which, in the authors' opinion, hold particular promise to propel the AAV vector field \u2026"

The process of how Dicer substrate small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are loaded into different mammalian Agos in vivo is not well established. Here we report that shRNAs are loaded into mammalian Agos in two stepwise processes, physical association and activation, with the latter being the rate-limiting step with noncleaving RISC. We establish that, although RNA duplexes processed from shRNAs bind to Agos in cells with similar affinity, the degree by which the complexes are activated (coupled with the removal of the passenger strand) correlates with the thermodynamic instability of RNA duplexes being loaded rather than the structure of the RNA, as was \u2026"

A large part of the attraction of CRISPR stems from the small size of its two core components \u2013 Cas9 and gRNA \u2013 and hence its compatibility with virtually any available viral vector delivery system. As a result, over the past two years, four major classes of viral vectors have already been engineered and applied as CRISPR delivery tools \u2013 retroviruses, lentiviruses, adenoviruses, and adeno\u2010associated viruses (AAVs). The juxtaposition of these two technologies reflects a case of tremendous mutual attraction and holds unprecedented promises for biology and medicine.

In contrast, nearly all cells positive for Rep68/Rep40 were also positive for capsid protein expression.

Here we review this exciting approach, to trigger RNA interference in vitro and in vivo by shRNA expressed from AAV vectors, and describe the state-of-the-art technology for vector particle generation. In particular, we present a set of novel AAV vector plasmids that were specifically designed for the easy and rapid cloning of shRNA expression cassettes into AAV.

How IECs regulate their innate immune response to maintain gut homeostasis remains unclear. Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines produced during infections. While type I IFN receptors are ubiquitously expressed, type III IFN receptors are expressed only on epithelial cells. This epithelium specificity strongly suggests exclusive functions at epithelial surfaces, but the relative roles of type I and III IFNs in the establishment of an antiviral innate immune response in human IECs are not clearly defined. Here, we used mini-gut organoids to define the functions of types I and III IFNs to protect the human gut against viral infection. We show that primary non-transformed human IECs, upon viral challenge, upregulate the expression of both type I and type III IFNs at the transcriptional level but only secrete type III IFN in the supernatant. However, human IECs respond to both type I and type III IFNs by producing IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that in turn induce an antiviral state. Using genetic ablation of either type I or type III IFN receptors, we show that either IFN can independently restrict virus infection in human IECs. Importantly, we report, for the first-time, differences in the mechanisms by which each IFN establishes the antiviral state. Contrary to type I IFN, the antiviral activity induced by type III IFN is strongly dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, suggesting a pathway used by type III IFNs that non-redundantly contributes to the antiviral state. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hIECs specifically regulate their innate \u2026"

NPC1 is essential for transporting cholesterol and other lipids out of lysosomes, but little is known about the mechanisms that control its cellular abundance and localization. Here we show that a reduction of TMEM97, a cholesterol-responsive NPC1-binding protein, increases NPC1 levels in cells through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Reducing TMEM97 through RNA-interference reduces lysosomal lipid storage and restores cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum in cell models of NP-C. In TMEM97 knockdown cells, NPC1 levels can be reinstated with wild type TMEM97, but not TMEM97 missing an ER-retention signal suggesting that TMEM97 contributes to controlling the availability of NPC1 to the cell. Importantly, knockdown of TMEM97 also increases levels \u2026"

To render CRISPR-based therapies precise and safe, strategies to confine the activity of Cas(9) to selected cells and tissues are highly desired. Here, we developed a cell type-specific Cas-ON switch based on miRNA-regulated expression of anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins. We inserted target sites for miR-122 or miR-1, which are abundant specifically in liver and cardiac muscle cells, respectively, into the 3\u2032UTR of Acr transgenes. Co-expressing these with Cas9 and sgRNAs resulted in Acr knockdown and released Cas9 activity solely in hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes, while Cas9 was efficiently inhibited in off-target cells. We demonstrate control of genome editing and gene activation using a miR-dependent AcrIIA4 in combination with different Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy \u2026"

It is also a rate-limiting factor whose saturation by si/shRNAs limits RNAi efficiency and causes numerous adverse side effects. Here, we report a set of versatile tools and widely applicable strategies for transient or stable Ago2 co-expression, which overcome these concerns. Specifically, we engineered plasmids and viral vectors to co-encode a codon-optimized human Ago2 cDNA along with custom shRNAs. Furthermore, we stably integrated this Ago2 cDNA into a panel of standard human cell lines via plasmid transfection or lentiviral transduction. Using various endo- or exogenous targets, we demonstrate the potential of all three strategies to boost mRNA silencing efficiencies \u2026"

The standard diagnostic pipeline for testing SARS-CoV-2 presence in patients with an ongoing infection is predominantly based on pharyngeal swabs, from which the viral RNA is extracted using commercial kits, followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR detection. As a result of the large demand for testing, commercial RNA extraction kits may be limited and, alternatively, non-commercial protocols are needed. Here, we provide a magnetic bead RNA extraction protocol that is predominantly based on in-house made reagents and is performed in 96-well plates supporting large-scale testing. Magnetic bead RNA extraction was benchmarked against the commercial QIAcube extraction platform. Comparable viral RNA detection sensitivity and specificity were obtained by fluorescent and colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) using a primer set targeting the N gene, as well as RT-qPCR using a primer set targeting the E gene, showing that the RNA extraction protocol presented here can be combined with a variety of detection methods at high throughput. Importantly, the presented diagnostic workflow can be quickly set up in a laboratory without access to an automated pipetting robot."

IFN also induces the expression of ISGs that function as negative regulators to limit the strength and duration of IFN response. The ISGs identified so far belong to coding genes. However, only a small proportion of the transcriptome corresponds to coding transcripts and it has been estimated that there could be as many coding as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To address whether IFN can also regulate the expression of lncRNAs, we analyzed the transcriptome of HuH7 cells treated or not with IFN\u03b12 by expression arrays. Analysis of the arrays showed increased levels of several well-characterized coding genes that respond to IFN both at early or late times. Furthermore, we identified several IFN-stimulated or -downregulated lncRNAs (ISRs and IDRs). Further validation showed that ISR2, 8 and 12 expression mimics that of their neighboring genes GBP1, IRF1 and IL6, respectively, all related to the IFN response. These genes are induced in response to different doses of IFN\u03b12 in different cell lines at early (ISR2 or 8) or later (ISR12) time points. IFN\u03b2 also induced the expression of these lncRNAs. ISR2 and 8 were also induced by an influenza virus unable to block the IFN response but not by other wild-type lytic viruses tested. Surprisingly, both ISR2 and 8 were significantly upregulated in cultured cells and livers from patients infected with HCV. Increased levels of ISR2 were also detected in patients chronically infected with HIV. This is \u2026"

As expected, the shRNAs silenced hepatic p53 and accelerated liver tumorigenesis when MYC was concurrently expressed. Surprisingly, various irrelevant control shRNAs similarly induced a rapid onset of tumorigenesis, comparable to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), a potent carcinogen. We found that even marginal shRNA doses can already trigger histologically detectable hepatoxicity and increased hepatocyte apoptosis. Moreover, we noted that shRNA expression globally dysregulated hepatic microRNA (miRNA) expression, and that shRNA levels and activity further increased in the presence of MYC.

To gain insight into the role of the covalent linkage of plasmid DNA to the expression cassette and transcriptional repression, and whether this silencing effect could be alleviated by altering the molecular structure of vector DNAs in vivo, we generated a scheme for converting routine plasmids into a purified expression cassette, free of bacterial DNA after gene transfer in vivo. To do this, the human \u03b1-1-antitrypsin (hAAT) and human clotting factor IX (hfIX) reporter genes were flanked by two ISceI endonuclease recognition sites, and coinjected together with a plasmid encoding the I-SceI cDNA or a control plasmid into mouse liver.

While effective in principle, this approach is not safe for use in humans as single surviving parasites can still cause disease. Here we use zinc-finger nucleases to generate attenuated parasite lines lacking an entire chromosome arm, by a timed induction of a double-strand break.

Here, we show that AAP is indeed essential for generation of functional recombinant AAV2 vectors in both mammalian and insect cell-based vector production systems. Surprisingly, we observed that AAV2 capsid proteins VP1 to -3 are unstable in the absence of AAP2, likely due to rapid proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of the proteasome led to an increase of intracellular VP1 to -3 but neither triggered assembly of functional capsids nor promoted nuclear localization of the capsid proteins.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can persist in astrocytes, contributing to the HIV burden and neurological dysfunctions in infected individuals. While a comprehensive approach to HIV cure must include the targeting of HIV\u20101 in astrocytes, dedicated tools for this purpose are still lacking. Here we report a novel Adeno\u2010associated virus\u2010based vector (AAV9P1) with a synthetic surface peptide for transduction of astrocytes. Analysis of AAV9P1 transduction efficiencies with single brain cell populations, including primary human brain cells, as well as human brain organoids demonstrated that AAV9P1 targeted terminally differentiated human astrocytes much more efficiently than neurons. We then investigated whether AAV9P1 can be used to deliver HIV\u2010inhibitory genes to \u2026"

Particularly attractive is the ease with which the viral capsid\u2014the major determinant of virus\u2013host interaction including cell specificity and antibody recognition\u2014can be modified and optimized at will. This has motivated countless researchers to develop high-throughput technologies in which genetically engineered AAV capsid libraries are subjected to a vastly hastened emulation of natural evolution, with the aim to enrich novel synthetic AAV capsids displaying superior features for clinical application. While the power and potential of these forward genetics approaches is undisputed, they are also inherently challenging as success depends on a combination of library quality \u2026"

It has been observed that in mammalian tissues, expression of Ago3 and Ago4 is dramatically lower compared with Ago1; however, an optimization of the Ago3 and Ago4 coding sequences to include only the most common codon at each amino acid position was able to augment the expression of Ago3 and Ago4 to levels comparable to that of Ago1 and Ago2.

However, in principle, the sense strand also possesses silencing capacity that may contribute to adverse RNAi side effects including off-target gene regulation. Here, we address this concern with a novel strategy that reduces sense strand activity of vector-encoded shRNAs via codelivery of inhibitory tough decoy (TuD) RNAs. Using various shRNAs for proof of concept, we validate that coexpression of TuDs can sequester and inactivate shRNA sense strands in human cells selectively without affecting desired antisense activities from the same shRNAs. Moreover, we show how coexpressed TuDs can alleviate shRNA-mediated perturbation of global gene expression by specifically de-repressing off-target transcripts carrying seed matches to the shRNA sense \u2026"

These include the apathogenicity of the underlying wildtype viruses and the highly advanced methodologies for production of high-titer, high-purity and clinical-grade recombinant vectors2. A further particular advantage of the AAV system over other viruses is the availability of a wealth of naturally occurring serotypes which differ in essential properties yet can all be easily engineered as vectors using a common protocol1,2. Moreover, a number of groups including our own have recently devised strategies to use these natural viruses as templates for the creation of synthetic vectors which either combine the assets of multiple input serotypes, or which enhance the properties of a single isolate. The respective technologies to achieve these goals are either DNA family shuffling3, i.e. fragmentation of various AAV capsid genes followed by their re-assembly based on partial homologies (typically >80% for most AAV serotypes), or peptide display4,5, i.e. insertion of usually seven amino acids into an exposed loop of the viral capsid where the peptide ideally mediates re-targeting to a desired cell type. For maximum success, both methods are applied in a high-throughput fashion whereby the protocols are up-scaled to yield libraries of around one million distinct capsid variants. Each clone is then comprised of a unique combination of numerous parental viruses (DNA shuffling approach) or contains a distinctive peptide within the same viral backbone (peptide display \u2026"

Reversal of the transformed phenotype by inhibiting E6/E7 gene expression therefore provides a suitable goal for future tumor therapy. Using recombinant adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) vectors, two types of therapeutic genes were expressed in cervical carcinoma cells with the aim of suppressing the E6/E7 oncogenes:(a) antisense E6/E7 and ribozyme genes and (b) the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) gene encoding MCP-1. Previous studies have shown that the MCP-1 protein is able to indirectly repress E6/E7 gene expression and is consistently absent in tumorigenic HPV-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines. Here, the effect of these therapeutic genes on tumor \u2026"

The stability of conventional ss ords AAV vector constructs can be enhanced, for example, to obtain a concurrent increase in vector titer and purity, as well as an improvement in vector safety, due at least in part to the elimination of stuffer DNA from the AAV vector. The method is broadly applicable to all gene transfer/therapy applications, such as those requiring delivery of foreign DNA containing recombinant gene expression cassettes. Such foreign DNA can range, for example, from about 0.2 up to about 5.2 kb in length. The enhanced vector constructs are highly flexible, user-friendly, and can be easily modified (via routine DNA cloning) and utilized (via standard AAV vector technology) by anyone skilled in the art."

To monitor transduction, we designed and tested a number of fusions between indicator-coding sequences of luciferase or gfp with effective HIV-1-directed antisense or ribozyme sequences. The combination of an indicator function and an antiviral func-tion in cis allows successful identification of transduced cells and measurement of effects on the replication of HIV-1 in antisense/ribozyme-expressing cells only.

However, it remains hampered by a need for vectors to express reprogramming factors (Oct-3/4, Klf4, Sox2, c-Myc; OKSM) in selected organs. Here, we report OKSM delivery vectors based on pseudotyped Adeno-associated virus (AAV). Using the AAV-DJ capsid, we could robustly reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts with low vector doses. Swapping to AAV8 permitted to efficiently reprogram somatic cells in adult mice by intravenous vector delivery, evidenced by hepatic or extra-hepatic teratomas and iPSC in the blood. Notably, we accomplished full in vivo reprogramming without c-Myc. Most iPSC generated in vitro or in vivo showed transcriptionally silent, intronic or intergenic vector integration, likely reflecting the increased host genome accessibility during \u2026"

We established a simple and versatile in vitro method for screening the efficacy of DNA-based short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and identified a highly effective shRNA targeting basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a gene thought to play important roles in endogenous neuroprotective responses in the rat retina. We used two viral vectors, based on lentivirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV), to deliver shRNAs and silence bFGF in retinal pigment epithelial cells in vivo. The AAV experiments made use of a \u201cstabilized double-stranded\u201d version of these vectors with rapid onset of gene expression. In the rat retinal pigment epithelium, shRNAs delivered by either vector reduced bFGF immunoreactivity to undetectable levels in transduced cells, whereas a nonfunctional control construct incorporating a two-base pair mutation had no measurable effect on bFGF expression. Silencing commenced within a few days after injection of virus and remained stable throughout the period of observation, as long as 60 days. Viral delivery of RNAi constructs offers a powerful and versatile approach for both gene therapy and the analysis of fundamental questions in retinal biology."

The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu antagonizes this restriction. Vpu reduces the cell surface density of the restriction factor and targets it for degradation; however, these activities are dispensable for enhancing particle release. Instead, Vpu has been suggested to antagonize CD317/tetherin by preventing recycling of internalized CD317/tetherin to the cell surface, blocking anterograde transport of newly synthesized CD317/tetherin, and/or displacing the restriction factor from virus assembly sites at the plasma membrane. At the molecular level, antagonism relies on the physical interaction of Vpu with CD317/tetherin. Recent findings suggested that phosphorylation of a diserine motif enables Vpu to bind to adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) trafficking complexes via two independent interaction motifs and to couple \u2026"

We combined two guide RNA genes, Cas9, and a self-linearizing repair template in one vector (AIO-SL) to correct fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) deficiency in mice. The vector genome of 5.73 kb was packaged into VP2-depleted AAV particles (AAV2/8\u0394VP2), which, however, did not improve cargo capacity. Reprogrammed hepatocytes were treated with AIO-SL.AAV2\u0394VP2 and subsequently transplanted, resulting in large clusters of FAH-positive hepatocytes. Direct injection of AIO-SL.AAV8\u0394VP2 likewise led to FAH expression and long-term survival. The AIO-SL vector achieved an \u223c6-fold higher degree of template integration than vectors without template self-linearization. Subsequent analysis revealed that AAV8 particles, in contrast to AAV2, incorporate oversized genomes distinctly \u2026"

Here, we comprehensively studied hepatic gene and miRNA expression in GAP-injected mice, and found both a broad activation of IFN\u03b3-associated pathways and a significant increase of murine microRNA-155 (miR-155), that was especially pronounced in non-parenchymal cells including liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells).

The immune response to bacterial-derived Cas9 has been speculated as a hurdle for AAV-CRISPR therapy. However, immunological consequences of AAV-mediated Cas9 expression have thus far not been thoroughly investigated in large mammals. We evaluate Cas9-specific immune responses in canine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) following intramuscular and intravenous AAV-CRISPR therapy. Treatment results initially in robust dystrophin restoration in affected dogs but also induces muscle inflammation, and Cas9-specific humoral and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses that are not prevented by the muscle-specific promoter and transient prednisolone immune suppression. In normal dogs, AAV-mediated Cas9 expression induces similar, though milder, immune responses. In \u2026"

Here, we highlight a set of exciting new strategies that aim at further increasing the therapeutic index of CRISPR technologies, by reducing the size of Cas9 expression cassettes and thus enhancing their compatibility with viral gene delivery vectors. Specifically, we discuss the concept of splitCas9 whereby the Cas9 holo\u2010protein is segregated into two parts that are expressed individually and reunited in the cell by \u2026"

Recently, the authors' group has specifically studied AAP's relevance during production of AAV gene therapy vectors in mammalian or insect cells, and AAP was found to be essential for capsid protein stabilization and generation of functional vector particles. Here, the lingering question is additionally addressed of whether molecular AAV evolution via DNA family shuffling of viral capsid genes would perturb AAP functionality due to concurrent and inadvertent recombination of the AAP open reading frame. To this end, a battery of complementary experiments was conducted in which: (1) the ability of chimeric AAP from AAVDJ, a hybrid of serotypes 2, 8, and 9, was tested to rescue AAP knockouts in the three parental serotypes \u2026"

On the other hand, it is striking to witness a recent flurry of reports that highlight and partially close persistent gaps in our understanding of AAV virus and vector biology. This is all the more perplexing considering that recombinant AAVs have already been used in > 160 clinical trials and recently been commercialized as gene therapeutics.

Over the past 5 years, compelling evidence has been accumulated that this association is provided by dysregulations of specific mi(cro)RNAs and the ensuing aberrant expression of their target genes. Moreover, a string of interesting reports has now added proof that human disorders are also frequently characterized by global alterations in the RNAi machinery, comprising irregular expression and function of the key protein players Drosha, DGCR8, Exportin-5, Dicer, TRBP, and Argonaute. Here, we comprehensively review these emerging findings in the specific contexts of cancers and infections with viral pathogens and, in addition, describe related \u2026"

Traditionally, biogenic CH4 has been regarded as the final product of anoxic decomposition of organic matter by methanogenic archaea. However, plants,, fungi, algae and cyanobacteria can produce CH4 in the presence of oxygen. Although methanogens are known to produce CH4 enzymatically during anaerobic energy metabolism, the requirements and pathways for CH4 production by non-methanogenic cells are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CH4 formation by Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli is triggered by free iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are generated by metabolic activity and enhanced by oxidative stress.

Therefore, in vivo expansion of tolerized transplanted cells is emerging as a novel and clinically relevant potential alternative cellular therapy. Toward this aim, in the present study we established a new mouse model that combines HT with prior bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Donor hepatocytes were derived from human alpha(1)\u2010antitrypsin (hAAT) transgenic mice of the FVB strain. Serial serum enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays for hAAT protein were used to monitor hepatocyte engraftment and expansion.

As new Cas orthologues with advantageous properties are rapidly being discovered and engineered, the need for straightforward strategies to control their activity via exogenous stimuli persists. The Cas9 from Neisseria meningitidis (Nme) is a particularly small and target-specific Cas9 orthologue, and thus of high interest for in vivo genome editing applications. Here, we report the first optogenetic tool to control NmeCas9 activity in mammalian cells via an engineered, light-dependent anti-CRISPR (Acr) protein. Building on our previous Acr engineering work, we created hybrids between the NmeCas9 inhibitor AcrIIC3 and the LOV2 blue light sensory domain from Avena sativa.

Among the latter, Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are particularly attractive owing to many favorable traits: (1) their apathogenicity and episomal persistence, (2) the ease of virus production and purification, (3) the safe handling under lowest biosafety level 1 conditions, and (4) the availability of numerous natural serotypes and synthetic capsid variants with distinct cell specificities.

New means are therefore required to genetically modify adult NSCs for re-enabling endogenous brain repair. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are ideal gene-therapy vectors due to an excellent safety profile and high transduction efficiency. We thus conducted a high-throughput screening of 177 intraventricularly injected barcoded AAV variants profiled by RNA sequencing. Quantification of barcoded AAV mRNAs identified two synthetic capsids, peptide-modified derivative of wild-type AAV9 (AAV9_A2) and peptide-modified derivative of wild-type AAV1 (AAV1_P5), both of which transduce active and quiescent NSCs.

RNAi's unprecedented success as a gene knockdown tool is due, in part, to its simplicity; all that is required is a~ 21 nucleotide (nt) double-stranded RNA molecule engineered to match a sequence in the target gene.The path of RNAi delivery into cells follows a consistent pattern. Synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA)(3) or vector-encoded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) act as the RNAi trigger and when they arrive in the cell are incorporated into a multi-protein complex known as an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC \u2026"

SXC is performed by mixing an unpurified cell culture supernatant containing AAV particles with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and feeding the mixture onto a chromatography filter unit. The purified AAV particles are recovered by flushing the unit with a solution lacking PEG. SXC is an inexpensive single-use method that permits to concentrate, purify, and re-buffer AAV particles with yields >95% and >80% impurity clearance. SXC could theoretically be employed at industrial scales with units of nearly 20\u2009m2."

For proof-of-concept, we used TALE or CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases to site-specifically integrate an anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) shmiRNA into the liver-specific miR-122/hcr locus in hepatoma cells, with the aim to obtain cellular clones that are genetically protected against HCV infection. Using reporter assays, Northern blotting and qRT-PCR, we confirmed anti-HCV shmiRNA expression as well as miR-122 integrity and functionality in selected cellular progeny.

                "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has greatly facilitated and expanded our capacity to engineer mammalian genomes, including targeted gene knock-outs. However, the phenotyping of the knock-out effect requires a high DNA editing efficiency. Here, we report a user-friendly strategy based on the extrinsic apoptosis pathway that allows enrichment of a polyclonal gene-edited cell population, by selecting Cas9-transfected cells that co-express dominant-negative mutants of death receptors. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway can be triggered in many mammalian cell types, and ligands are easy to produce, do not require purification and kill much faster than the state-of-the-art selection drug puromycin. Stringent assessment of our advanced selection strategy via Sanger sequencing, T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) assay and direct phenotyping confirmed a strong and rapid enrichment of Cas9-expressing cell populations, in some cases reaching up to 100 % within one hour. Notably, the efficiency of target DNA cleavage in these enriched cells reached high levels that exceeded the reliable range of the T7E1 assay, a conclusion that can be generalized for editing efficiencies above 30 %. Moreover, our data emphasize that the insertion and deletion pattern induced by a specific gRNA is reproducible across different cell lines. The workflow and the findings reported here should streamline a wide array of future low- or high-throughput gene knock-out screens, and should largely improve data interpretation from CRISPR experiments."

To further unravel molecular mechanisms of adipose tissue function, genetic tools enabling functional studies in vitro and in vivo are essential. While the use of transgenic animals is well established, attempts using viral and non-viral vectors to genetically modify adipocytes in vivo are rare. Therefore, we here characterized recombinant Adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors regarding their potency as gene transfer vehicles for adipose tissue. Our results demonstrate that a single dose of systemically applied rAAV8-CMV-eGFP can give rise to remarkable transgene expression in murine adipose tissues. Upon transcriptional targeting of the rAAV8 vector to adipocytes using a 2.2 kb fragment of the murine adiponectin (mAP2.2) promoter, eGFP expression was significantly decreased in off-target tissues while efficient transduction was maintained in subcutaneous and visceral fat depots. Moreover, rAAV8-mAP2.2-mediated expression of perilipin A \u2013 a lipid-droplet-associated protein \u2013 resulted in significant changes in metabolic parameters only three weeks post vector administration. Taken together, our findings indicate that rAAV vector technology is applicable as a flexible tool to genetically modify adipocytes for functional proof-of-concept studies and the assessment of putative therapeutic targets in vivo."

Here, we analyzed a cohort of HBoV1-positive samples and managed to PCR amplify and sequence 29 distinct HBoV1 capsid variants. These differed from the originally reported HBoV1 reference strain in 32 nucleotides or four amino acids, including a frequent change of threonine to serine at position 590. Interestingly, this T590S mutation was associated with lower viral loads in infected patients. Analysis of the time course of infection in two patients for up to 15\u2009weeks revealed a gradual accumulation of T590S, concurrent with drops in viral loads.

Still, recent reports of fatalities in a clinical trial for a neuromuscular disease, although linked to an exceptionally high vector dose, have raised new caution about the safety of recombinant AAVs. Moreover, concerns linger about the presence of pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies in the human population, which precludes a significant percentage of patients from receiving, and benefitting from, AAV gene therapies. These concerns are exacerbated by observations of cellular immune responses and other adverse events, including detrimental off-target \u2026"

Particularly attractive would be the possibility to deliver clinically relevant DNA to muscle tissue from a minimally invasive, intravenous vector delivery. To date, this aim has been approximated by the use of Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) of different serotypes (rh.74, 8, 9) that are effective, but unfortunately not specific to the muscle and hence not ideal for use in patients. Here, we have thus studied the muscle tropism and activity of another AAV serotype, AAVpo1, that was previously isolated from pigs and found to efficiently transduce muscle following direct intramuscular injection in mice. The new data reported here substantiate the usefulness of AAVpo1 for muscle gene \u2026"

This chromosomal region includes the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) gene which has a crucial role in innate immune signaling and was observed to be functionally and prognostically relevant in different cancer entities. Therefore, we correlated the presence of MAP3K7 deletions with clinical parameters in a cohort of 327 pediatric T-ALL patients and investigated the function of MAP3K7 in the T-ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM, Jurkat and MOLT-4. MAP3K7 deletions were detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). T-ALL cell lines were transduced with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing anti-MAP3K7 shRNA or a non-silencing shRNA together with a GFP reporter. Transduction efficiency was measured by flow cytometry and depletion efficiency by RT-PCR and Western blots. Induction of apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry after staining with PE-conjugated Annexin V. In order to assess the contribution of NF-\u03baB signaling to the effects of MAP3K7 depletion, cells were treated with TNF-\u03b1 and cell lysates analyzed for components of the NF-\u03baB pathway by Western blotting and for expression of the NF-\u03baB target genes BCL2, CMYC, FAS, PTEN and TNF-\u03b1 by RT-PCR. MAP3K7 is deleted in approximately 10% and point-mutated in approximately 1% of children with T-ALL. In 32 of 33 leukemias the deletion of MAP3K7 also included the adjacent CASP8AP2 gene. MAP3K7 deletions were associated with the occurrence of SIL-TAL1 fusions and a mature immunophenotype, but not \u2026"

Yet, the reasons underlying this regeneration failure are not fully understood. Here, we study the transcriptome and translatome shortly after spinal cord injury. Profiling of the total and ribosome-bound RNA in injured and na\u00efve spinal cords identify a substantial post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In particular, transcripts associated with nervous system development were down-regulated in the total RNA fraction while remaining stably loaded onto ribosomes. Interestingly, motif association analysis of post-transcriptionally regulated transcripts identified the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) as enriched in a subset of these transcripts that was more resistant to injury-induced reduction at transcriptome level. Modulation of these transcripts by overexpression of the CPE binding protein, Cpeb1, in mouse and Drosophila CNS neurons promoted axonal regeneration following injury. Our study uncovers a global evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional mechanism enhancing regeneration of injured CNS axons."

Despite its lower functional titer, mCD8-LV achieved 4-fold higher gene delivery to CD8+ cells than conventional VSV-LV when added to whole mouse blood.

Since then, we and others have demonstrated that exosome-enveloped AAV, exo-AAV, can enhance transduction in vivo as well as evade neutralizing antibodies.While promising, these data were generated with differential centrifugation to pellet the exo-AAV. This method results in a heterogeneous mixture of exo-AAV, coprecipitating proteins, as well as free AAV capsids. To define the properties of exo-AAV more accurately, in this study, we used a density gradient method to purify exo-AAV.

We show that in the developing cerebellum Tie2 expression is not restricted to blood vessels, but it is also present in PCs. Its ligands angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) are expressed in neural cells and endothelial cells (ECs), respectively. PC-specific deletion of Tie2 results in reduced dendritic arborization, which is recapitulated in neural-specific Ang1-knockout and Ang2 full-knockout mice. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing reveals that Tie2-deficient PCs present alterations in gene expression of multiple genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, dendritic formation, growth, and branching. Functionally, mice with deletion of Tie2 in PCs present alterations in PC \u2026"

In cultured monkey cells and human gut organoids, our most potent vector, SAVIOR (SARS virus repressor), suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection to background levels. Strikingly, in control experiments using single shRNAs, multiple SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants quickly emerged from infected cells within 24\u201348 h.

Consequently, cardiomyocyte-specific inactivation of the TRPM4 function appears to be a promising strategy to improve cardiac contractility in heart failure patients. The aim of this study was to develop a gene therapy approach in mice that specifically silences the expression of TRPM4 in cardiomyocytes. First, short hairpin RNAmiR30 (shRNAmiR30) sequences against the TRPM4 mRNA were screened in vitro using lentiviral transduction for a stable expression of the shRNA cassettes.

Gorilla bocavirus 1 (GBoV1) VP3 shares 86% amino acid sequence identity with HBoV1 but has better transduction efficiency in several human cell types. Here, we report the capsid structure of GBoV1 determined to 2.76 \u00c5 resolution using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and its interaction with mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and human sera. GBoV1 shares capsid surface morphologies with other parvoviruses, with a channel at the 5-fold symmetry axis, protrusions surrounding the 3-fold axis and a depression at the 2-fold axis. A 2/5-fold wall separates the 2-fold and 5-fold axes. Compared to HBoV1, differences are localized to the 3-fold protrusions. Consistently, native dot immunoblots and cryo-EM showed cross-reactivity and binding, respectively, by a 5-fold targeted HBoV1 mAb, 15C6. Surprisingly, recognition was observed for one out of three 3-fold targeted mAbs, 12C1, indicating some structural similarity at this region. In addition, GBoV1, tested against 40 human sera, showed the similar rates of seropositivity as HBoV1. Immunogenic reactivity against parvoviral vectors is a significant barrier to efficient gene delivery. This study is a step towards optimizing bocaparvovirus vectors with antibody escape properties."

Despite these encouraging developments and the growing interest in causative treatments for hearing disorders, gene therapeutic interventions in the inner ear remain in their infancy and await clinical translation. This review focuses on the adeno-associated virus (AAV), which nowadays represents one of the safest and most promising vectors in gene therapy.

However, remaining problems with AAV vectors include the high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to at least some of the wildtype viruses in humans, and the fact that many relevant cell types are largely refractory to most AAV serotypes. Several strategies were proposed to overcome these hurdles, such as peptide insertion into the AAV-2 capsid or its site-directed mutagenesis, but required knowledge of the capsid structure and were thus restricted. Here, we pursued a most powerful approach to functional diversification of the AAV virion, by in vitro recombining the capsid genes of eight divergent primate and non-primate serotypes.

Cells and tissues in the intermediate states of reprogramming upregulate the expression of NK-activating ligands, such as MULT1 and ICAM1. NK cells recognize and kill partially reprogrammed cells in a degranulation-dependent manner. Importantly, in vivo partial reprogramming is strongly reduced by adoptive transfer of NK cells, whereas it is significantly increased by their depletion.

We designed 20 different shRNAs, targeting the genome of the HEV genotype 3 (GT3) Kernow\u2010C1 p6 strain, for delivery upon AAV6 transduction. Using an original selectable HEV GT3 reporter replicon, we identified three shRNAs that efficiently down\u2010regulated HEV replication. We further confirmed their inhibitory potency with full\u2010length HEV infection. Seventy\u2010two hours following transduction, HEV replication in both systems decreased by up to 95%. The three most potent inhibitory shRNAs identified were directed against the methyltransferase domain, the junction region between the open reading frames (ORFs), and the 3\u00b4 \u2026"

To fully realize and harness this potential, the availability of gene transfer vehicles (\u201cvectors\u201d) that are easily produced and that allow to deliver the essential components to desired target cells in an efficient manner is key. For in vivo applications, it is, moreover, important that these vectors exhibit a high degree of cell specificity in order to reduce the risk of adverse side effects in off-targets and to minimize manufacturing costs. Here, we describe a set of basic protocols for the cloning, production, purification, and quality control of a particular vector that can fulfill all these requirements, that is, recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV).

We are currently establishing the relative transduction efficiencies using standard length and expanded genome sizes in order to establish the maximal DNA length that can be functionally packaged by these new vectors. We believe our capsid alteration strategy can be extrapolated to other serotypes with distinct tissue tropism and applied in vivo to treat hemophilia A and other monogenic disorders suitable to replacement therapy."

It is widespread in eukaryotic evolution, but factors that influence trans splicing acceptor site choice have been little investigated. In Kinetoplastids, all protein-coding mRNAs are 5\u2019 trans spliced. A polypyrimidine tract is usually found upstream of the AG splice acceptor, but there is no branch point consensus; moreover, splicing dictates polyadenylation of the preceding mRNA, which is a validated drug target.   Methodology and principal findings We here describe a trans splicing reporter system that can be used for studies and screens concerning the roles of sequences and proteins in processing site choice and efficiency. Splicing was poor with poly(U) tracts less than 9 nt long, and was influenced by an intergenic region secondary structure. A screen for signals resulted in selection of sequences that were on average 45% U and 35% C. Tethering of either the splicing factor SF1, or the cleavage and polyadenylation factor CPSF3 within the intron stimulated processing in the correct positions, while tethering of two possible homologues of Opisthokont PTB inhibited processing. In contrast, tethering of SR-domain proteins RBSR1, RBSR2, or TSR1 or its interaction partner TSR1IP, promoted use of alternative signals upstream of the tethering sites. RBSR1 interacts predominantly with proteins implicated in splicing, whereas the interactome of RBSR2 is more diverse.   Conclusions Our selectable constructs are suitable for screens of both sequences, and proteins that affect mRNA processing in T. brucei. Our results suggest that the functions of \u2026"

For over half a century, their intriguing biology and pathophysiology has fueled intensive research aimed at dissecting the underlying viral and cellular mechanisms. Concurrently, their broad host specificity (tropism) has motivated efforts to develop parvoviruses as gene delivery vectors for human cancer or gene therapy applications. While the sum of preclinical and clinical data consistently demonstrates the great potential of these vectors, these findings also illustrate the importance of enhancing and restricting in vivo transgene expression in desired cell types. To this end, major progress has been made especially with vectors based on Adeno-associated virus (AAV), whose capsid is highly amenable to bioengineering, repurposing and expansion of its natural tropism. Here, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches to create new AAV variants with higher specificity and efficiency of gene transfer in on-target cells. We first review traditional and novel directed evolution approaches, including high-throughput screening of AAV capsid libraries. Next, we discuss programmable receptor-mediated targeting with a focus on two recent technologies that utilize high-affinity binders. Finally, we highlight one of the latest stratagems for rational AAV vector characterization and optimization, namely, machine learning, which promises to facilitate and accelerate the identification of next-generation, safe and precise gene delivery vehicles."

Additionally, an RNA-seq-based comparison permitted the authors to identify side effects of agshRNAs or their conventional shRNA counterparts. Thereby, this study concurrently and compellingly demonstrates the potential to improve RNAi safety and efficiency, as well as the power of assays to monitor sequence-specific or-unspecific side effects.

For these patients, conferring light-sensing abilities to the remaining interneurons of the ON circuit (i.e., ON bipolar cells) using optogenetic tools poses an alternative treatment strategy. Such treatments, however, are hampered by the lack of efficient gene delivery tools targeting ON bipolar cells, which in turn rely on the effective isolation of these cells to facilitate tool development.

Cellular reprogramming is commonly induced by the ectopic expression of a transcription factor cocktail composed by Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc (abbreviated as OSKM), and its efficiency and kinetics are strongly dependent on the presence of Myc. Here, we describe a versatile method to study reprogramming in vivo based on the use of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, which allows the targeting of specific organs and cell types.

                "abstract": "The adult mammalian brain entails a reservoir of neural stem cells (NSCs) generating glial cells and neurons. However, NSCs become increasingly quiescent with age, which hampers their regenerative capacity. New means are therefore required to genetically modify adult NSCs for re-enabling endogenous brain repair. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are ideal gene therapy vectors due to an excellent safety profile and high transduction efficiency. We thus conducted a high-throughput screening of 177 intraventricularly injected barcoded AAV variants profiled by RNA sequencing. Quantification of barcoded AAV mRNAs identified two synthetic capsids, AAV9_A2 and AAV1_P5, both of which transduce active and quiescent NSCs. Further optimization of AAV1_P5 by judicious selection of promoter and dose of injected viral genomes enabled labeling of 30-60% of the NSC compartment, which was validated by FACS analyses and single cell RNA sequencing. Importantly, transduced NSC readily produced neurons. The present study identifies AAV variants with a high regional tropism towards the v-SVZ with high efficiency in targeting adult NSCs, thereby paving the way for preclinical testing of regenerative gene therapy."

The stability of conventional ss or dsAAV vector constructs can be enhanced, for example, to obtain a concurrent increase in vector titer and purity, as well as an improvement in vector safety, due at least in part to the elimination of stuffer DNA from the AAV vector. The method is broadly applicable to all gene transfer/therapy applications, such as those requiring delivery of foreign DNA containing recombinant gene expression cassettes. Such foreign DNA can range, for example, from about 0. 2 up to about 5. 2 kb in length. The enhanced vector constructs are highly flexible, user-friendly, and can be easily modified (via routine DNA cloning) and \u2026"

We combined two powerful technologies, synthetic AAV vectors and CRISPR-mediated gene engineering, with the ultimate aim to eliminate integrated HIV from latently infected human cells.

Yet, recent evidence suggests that over-dosing RNAi can have detrimental side effects on cells and tissues, and cause toxicities and lethalities in small animals. Unlike previously noted adverse effects, these new phenomena are unrelated to RNAi sequences but rather involve saturation of cellular gene silencing pathways. Considering the importance of these alarming findings for the clinical translation of RNAi technologies, we review the underlying mechanisms and discuss potential solutions."

A minimal G6Pase promoter containing insulin-responsive sequence elements was placed upstream of the human G6Pase cDNA in AAV-GRPhG6PpA. This vector was pseudotyped as AAV2/8 and administered to two week-old affected GSD-Ia mice (3 x 1011 DNase-resistant vector particles; 6 x 1013 particles/kg). An AAV2/8 vector containing the universally active CB promoter, AAV-CBcG6PpA, was also administered to affected GSD-Ia mice; however, the CB promoter is NOT glucose-responsive.

In these vectors, the shRNA expression cassette is typically flanked by a full-length AAV-2 ITR (inverted terminal repeat) and a mutant form devoid of the terminal resolution site (trs), blocking the AAV DNA replication cycle and creating the ds phenotype. However, two inherent drawbacks have prevented the clinical evaluation of dsAAVs thus far: 1) the near sequence identity of the mutant and intact ITRs promotes their frequent recombination, resulting in repair of the mutation or in partial ITR deletion, and thus loss of the ds phenotype; and 2) the usually small size of shRNA expression cassettes, and the presumed lower DNA packaging limit of AAV capsids, require the additional and undesirable \u2026"

Therefore, an AAV-2 genome encoding the hfIX gene was crosspackaged into capsids of AAV types 1 to 6, using efficient large-scale technology for particle production and purification. In immunocompetent mice, the resulting vector particles expressed high hFIX levels ranging from 36%(AAV-4) to over 2000% of normal (AAV-1,-2 and-6), which would exceed curative levels in hemophilic humans. Expression was dose-and time-dependent, with AAV-6 directing the fastest and strongest onset of hFIX expression at all doses. Interestingly, systemic administration of 2x10 12 vector particles of AAV-1,-4 or-6 resulted in hFIX levels similar to those achieved by portal vein delivery. For all other serotypes and particle doses, hepatic vector administration yielded up to 84-fold more hFIX protein than tail vein delivery, corroborated by similarly increased vector DNA copy numbers in the liver, and elicited a reduced immune response against the viral capsids. Finally, neutralization assays showed variable immunologic cross-reactions between most of the AAV serotypes. Our technology and findings should facilitate the development of AAV pseudotypebased gene therapies for hemophilia B and other liver-related diseases."

Equally attractive is the wealth of natural AAV variants that can be harnessed as vectors or molecularly evolved into designer AAVs. A particularly interesting group of 15 variants dubbed AAVHSC, related to AAV clade F and differing from each other by one to four amino acids, was isolated from CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells. The latest work from Smith and colleagues now finds that a specific member of the AAVHSC group, AAVHSC16, is distinguished by its lack of binding to membrane-exposed galactose; 1 the latter acts as a primary receptor for the other AAVHSCs and the clade F prototype AAV9. Mutagenesis and residue swapping identified two distinct amino acids at positions 501 and 706 as most critical for \u2026"

The G\u2009>\u2009A transition at position c.845 of the gene causes misfolding of the HFE protein, ultimately resulting in its absence at the cell membrane. Consequently, the lack of interaction with the transferrin receptors 1 and 2 leads to systemic iron overload. We screened potential gRNAs in a highly precise cell culture assay and applied an AAV8 split-vector expressing the adenine base editor ABE7.10 and our candidate gRNA in 129-Hfetm.1.1Nca mice. Here we show that a single injection of our therapeutic vector leads to a gene correction rate of >10% and improved iron metabolism in the liver. Our study presents a proof-of-concept for a targeted gene correction therapy for one of the most frequent hereditary diseases affecting humans."

To overcome this limitation, we established a novel strategy for gene therapy, combining tumor cell-specific adeno-associated virus (AAV) variants with oncogene-specific CRISPR-Cas nucleases. We screened 177 different Cas9/gRNA combinations targeting the genes encoding H3K27M or BRAFV600E, and identified highly specific nucleases that edited the oncogenic allele but left the respective WT loci intact, which we validated by PCR amplicon sequencing.

HEV is a non-enveloped virus, which circulates in the blood in a quasi-enveloped form. The quasi-envelope protects HEV particles from neutralising anti-capsid antibodies in the serum; however, most vaccine approaches are designed to induce an immune response against the HEV capsid. In this study, we explored systemic in vivo administration of a novel synthetic and myotropic Adeno-associated virus vector (AAVMYO3) to express the small HEV phosphoprotein ORF3 (found on quasi-enveloped HEV) in the musculature of mice, resulting in the robust and dose-dependent formation of anti-ORF3 antibodies. Neutralisation assays using the serum of ORF3 AAV-transduced mice showed a modest inhibitory effect on the infection of quasi-enveloped HEV in vivo, comparable to previously characterised anti-ORF3 antibodies used as a control. The novel AAVMYO3 capsid used in this study can serve as a versatile platform for the continued development of vector-based vaccines against HEV and other infectious agents, which could complement traditional vaccines akin to the current positive experience with SARS-CoV-2."

Targeting of specific cell subsets with AAV is limited by the broad tropism of AAV serotypes. Nanobodies are single immunoglobulin variable domains from heavy chain antibodies that naturally occur in camelids. Their small size and high solubility allow easy reformatting into fusion proteins. In this chapter we provide protocols for inserting a P2X7-specific nanobody into a surface loop of the VP1 capsid protein of AAV2. Such nanobody-displaying recombinant AAV allow 50- to 500-fold stronger transduction of P2X7-expressing cells than the parental AAV. We provide protocols for monitoring the transduction of P2X7-expressing cells by nanobody-displaying rAAV by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy."

Despite its importance, live imaging of the AIS is challenging due to the limited number of suitable labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we established a novel approach for live labeling of the AIS using unnatural amino acids (UAAs) and bioorthogonal click chemistry. The small size of the UAAs and the possibility of introducing them virtually anywhere into the target proteins make this method particularly suitable for live labeling and imaging of complex and spatially restricted proteins. With this approach, we labeled two large AIS components, the 186 kDa isoform of neurofascin (NF186) and the 260 kDa voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.6), and performed widefield and confocal microscopy in fixed and living neurons. Moreover, we demonstrated the applicability of this method by studying the localization of two epilepsy-causing NaV1.6 variants with a loss-of-function effect. Finally, to further improve the efficiency of the UAA incorporation, we developed adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for click labeling in primary neurons. The use of AAV vectors will facilitate the transfer of UAA-based click labeling technology to more complex biological systems, such as organotypic slice cultures, organoids, and animal models."

Still, recent reports of fatalities in a clinical trial for a neuromuscular disease, although linked to an exceptionally high vector dose, have raised new caution about the safety of recombinant AAVs. Moreover, concerns linger about the presence of pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies in the human population, which precludes a significant percentage of patients from receiving, and benefitting from, AAV gene therapies. These concerns are exacerbated by observations of cellular immune responses and other adverse events, including detrimental off-target \u2026"

So many shared moments and days to remember come to my mind and to my heart now\u2026. I should perhaps mention when I first met Mavis and her husband Rob in Warwick (UK), we immediately realized how complementary our respective fields of expertise were, and so that visit set a fruitful collaboration of several years on structure-function analysis of parvovirus MVM capsid. Mavis turned out to be a surprising collaborator, not only because of her wide range of knowledge, but mainly because her unique scientific passion. She never stopped questioning assumed principles, asking for fine details of any kind of methodology, or proposing sophisticated experiments to address the most intricated aspects of parvovirus biology. And all that came mixed up with a positive attitude and frequent laughs that made challenging science a job easy to enjoy.It is also impossible not to remember Mavis\u2019s openings of Parvovirus meetings, as happened for example in Granada and Cordoba, when I felt tied up by the unavoidable rigid atmosphere of the meeting start up. Amazingly, she lightened the mood from the very first second with her powerful enthusiasm and warm manner of presenting data, which relaxed everyone in the hall at once, and miraculously drove an easy flow of science and friendship among us along the rest of the meeting."

Gorilla bocavirus 1 (GBoV1) VP3 shares 86% amino acid sequence identity with HBoV1 but has better transduction efficiency in several human cell types. Here, we report the capsid structure of GBoV1 determined to 2.76 \u00c5 resolution using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and its interaction with mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and human sera. GBoV1 shares capsid surface morphologies with other parvoviruses, with a channel at the 5-fold symmetry axis, protrusions surrounding the 3-fold axis and a depression at the 2-fold axis. A 2/5-fold wall separates the 2-fold and 5-fold axes. Compared to HBoV1, differences are localized to the 3-fold protrusions. Consistently, native dot immunoblots and cryo-EM showed cross-reactivity and binding, respectively, by a 5-fold targeted HBoV1 mAb, 15C6. Surprisingly, recognition was observed for one out of three 3-fold targeted mAbs, 12C1, indicating some structural similarity at this region. In addition, GBoV1, tested against 40 human sera, showed the similar rates of seropositivity as HBoV1. Immunogenic reactivity against parvoviral vectors is a significant barrier to efficient gene delivery. This study is a step towards optimizing bocaparvovirus vectors with antibody escape properties."

We combined two guide RNA genes, Cas9, and a self-linearizing repair template in one vector (AIO-SL) to correct fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) deficiency in mice. The vector genome of 5.73 kb was packaged into VP2-depleted AAV particles (AAV2/8\u0394VP2), which, however, did not improve cargo capacity. Reprogrammed hepatocytes were treated with AIO-SL.AAV2\u0394VP2 and subsequently transplanted, resulting in large clusters of FAH-positive hepatocytes. Direct injection of AIO-SL.AAV8\u0394VP2 likewise led to FAH expression and long-term survival. The AIO-SL vector achieved an \u223c6-fold higher degree of template integration than vectors without template self-linearization. Subsequent analysis revealed that AAV8 particles, in contrast to AAV2, incorporate oversized genomes distinctly greater than 5.2 kb. Finally, our AAV8-based vector represents a promising tool for gene editing strategies to correct monogenic liver diseases requiring (large) fragment removal and/or simultaneous sequence replacement."

In this operation, selectivity is influenced strongly by the target species\u2019 size, so SXC is well suited for purification of virus particles. The purified product is recovered at physiological pH and conductivity. We have observed recoveries above 95% for several cell culture-based virus particles used as viral gene transfer vectors or as viral vaccines, including: adeno-associated virus (AAV), Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, influenza virus, and yellow fever virus. Preliminary data for purification of lentiviruses suggests recoveries exceeding 60%. Host cell DNA and protein depletion are typically above 90% and infectivity is not compromised thanks to the inert character of PEG towards biomolecules and the mild elution conditions."

Particularly attractive is the ease with which the viral capsid\u2014the major determinant of virus-host interaction including cell specificity and antibody recognition\u2014can be modified and optimized at will. This has motivated countless researchers to develop high-throughput technologies in which genetically engineered AAV capsid libraries are subjected to a vastly hastened emulation of natural evolution, with the aim to enrich novel synthetic AAV capsids displaying superior features for clinical application. While the power and potential of these forward genetics approaches is undisputed, they are also inherently challenging as success depends on a combination of library quality \u2026"

This so-called assembly-activating protein or AAP appears to interact with the major viral capsid protein 3 (VP3) and to chaperone its assembly into virus-like particles, via mechanisms that remain unknown. Moreover, it was shown that deliberate mutation of the AAP gene diminishes AAV particle production. As the AAP open reading frame fully overlaps with that of the AAV capsid proteins VP1/VP2 (and partially VP3), it is likely that the AAP gene is inadvertently disrupted or mutated during molecular AAV evolution protocols that involve capsid gene shuffling (homology-directed recombination of cap gene fragments). To study this possibility comprehensively and to provide solutions, if needed, we first investigated the \u2026"

For the detection of vector integration sites into the host genome we routinely apply LAM-PCR. However, TES, in which we enrich for genomic regions that include vector sequences, has major advantages over LAM-PCR, as it neither depends on the existence of a vectorspecific primer binding site (often lost during rAAV integration) nor on a restriction site in the vicinity of the vector insertion site. Furthermore, regions that are captured together with the vector allow for relative quantification of vector copies per genome. As the entire vector can be sequenced by TES, mutations within the vector and transgene can be detected. In summary, we here provide \u2026"

Clin Invest 124: 4067, 2014). In order to study the potential of SCOs, we engineered a novel, Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-transgenic mouse carrying a mutated human BTK gene, originally found in an XLA family. In order to avoid any influence of mouse endogenous Btk protein, we bred the BAC-transgenic mice onto a Btk knockout background. In this model it was possible to correct the defect both in pro-B-cells in vitro, and also in mature B-cells, as demonstrated by the injection of SCOs in vivo. The corrected mRNA gave rise to a functional BTK protein. As a final proof \u2026"

Indeed, we found that Slicer and non-Slicers compete for shRNA loading and mRNA knockdown in a dose-dependent manner, readily explaining all prior observations of RNAi enhancement by Ago2 over-expression, or shRNA inhibition by Ago1/3/4, respectively. Importantly, the combination of GFP/RFP-Ago fusion constructs with the co-precipitation protocols newly established during this work should be widely useful to address other vital questions in the RNAi field, such as the selective processing of different cellular small RNAs by the four Ago proteins.

Under some circumstances, these diseases may need more than a single administration of the AAV-based therapeutic agent. One of the main concerns related to repeated AAV delivery is inhibition of cell transduction at the second infusion site by neutralizing antibodies (NAb) generated after the first exposure. In the present study, we evaluated the immune response after repeated AAV2 delivery to the brain in AAV2 seronegative Rhesus macaques. We infused AAV2-hAADC into left and right thalamus, with a 91-day delay between vector infusions. We determined the levels of anti-AAV2 NAb in sera weekly to monitor antibody production until necropsy 130 days after the first infusion. To ensure high levels of NAb before second infusion, we boosted the NAb production with 2 intramuscular AAV2-VLP immunizations \u2026"

Similarly, the DCN of the AAV-treated GM1 cat were hypointense to the surrounding gray matter as compared to the 7.5 mo. untreated GM1, in which the DCN and gray matter were isointense. MRS showed decreased N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA)/Creatine (Cr) increased choline (Cho)/Cr and increased Myoinositol (MI)/Cr in the 7.5 mo. old untreated GM1 cat as compared to normal. The AAV-treated GM1 cat showed increased NAA/Cr compared to normal. MI/Cr also was decreased in the AAV treated GM1 cat.

Current therapeutic options are unsatisfying, and life-long appliance of nucleoside-analogs can lead to side effects and selection of resistant mutants. A new therapeutic approach is to target viral mRNA transcripts for degradation by the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). This method holds immense potency since theoretically an effective and long-term suppression of viral transcripts can be achieved by a single dose of a vector encoding for a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA). fter initial enthusiasm, reports of severe side effects in animal studies hampered RNAi-based gene therapies entering the clinics. Several causative mechanisms have been proposed:(1) Oversaturation of endogenous factors, particular of Argonaute 2, leading to breakdown of microRNA \u2026"

In order to realize efficient generation of DMD model marmoset using rAAV, we investigated in vivo transgene expression patterns with rAAV transduction.

We recommend a new standard unit, RKDU (relative knock-down unit) to describe the knock-down efficiency of a miRNA-BS in a specific cell type. pSMB_miMeasure allows for an easy and fast measurement of RKDU while providing effective normalization against variance stemming from differences in transfection efficiency and from other sources."

This study evaluates the biology of second generation vectors based on the novel serotypes AAV7 and 8 containing self-complimentary (sc) genomes in both murine nonhuman primate livers. Superior murine liver transduction by sc over the traditional single stranded (ss) vector genomes was confirmed for all serotypes examined. Stable levels of transgene expression were achieved in cynomolgus macaques with efficiencies at least 2 logs higher than what was achieved with AAV2 vectors using ss genomes. In an attempt to understand molecular mechanisms responsible for the higher level gene transfer, we performed a series of detailed molecular studies of the vector genomes. This included treatment with exonuclease with specific substrate preferences, single cutter restriction enzyme digestion mediated and locus specific hybridization based vector genome mapping, bacteriophage Phi29 DNA polymerase mediated double stranded circular template specific isothermal rolling circle linear amplification for rescue, cloning and characterization of persisted circular genomes, and differential quantification of different populations of vector genomes by real time PCR. Our data indicated that the higher level of transgene expression achieved with the sc vectors was due to both increased numbers of persisting genomes and increased activity of these genomes. Study of the molecular dynamics of vector genome processing in murine liver revealed that both ss and sc vectors persisted as episomal circular forms but sc vectors were more \u2026"

To study the requirement for this factor and the cellular interactions that may contribute to photoreceptor survival, we used viral vector mediated expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down bFGF expression in vivo. Despite the promise of this approach for analyzing gene function in the retina, we are not aware of any published reports of the use of viral expression of shRNAs to knock down endogenous genes in the mammalian retina in vivo.Methods:: shRNAs were generated by PCR and tested in culture by transient transfection into HEK 293 cells, together with a bFGF\u2013GFP fusion target.

While recent gene therapy studies with osteogenic genes, eg, BMPs, yielded encouraging results in that they augmented bone production at the fracture site, none of the published strategies to date have accelerated bony union of the fracture gap, which is the hallmark of successful fracture repair. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (Cox-2) gene therapy in promoting bony union in a rat femur fracture model. The Cox-2 gene was chosen because Cox-2 promotes inflammation, angiogenesis, bone formation and bone resorption; all of these processes are essential for fracture repair. However, previous gene therapy with Cox-2 has been limited by the short \u2026"

Amongst these potential shRNA delivery vehicles, double-stranded (ds) vectors based on Adeno-associated virus (AAV) hold particular promise, since they give very robust and long-term gene expression in the transduced cell, while lacking any inherent toxicity. However, a variety of problems associated with the current generation of dsAAV vector constructs hamper their broad evaluation. Firstly, the constructs are relatively unstable in bacteria, due to the fact they contain two almost identical viral DNA packaging elements (ITRs) in close proximity. Secondly, encapsidation of the vector genomes also yields low particle titers, which might again be related to the use of two homologous \u2026"

Recently, we have provided evidence that rapid uncoating of the viral DNA from the AAV-8 capsid may be responsible for its enhanced transduction properties (Thomas et al., J. Virol. In press). Here, we have begun to analyse the role of another integral vector component, the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), which are short sequences flanking the genome and traditionally derived from AAV serotype 2.

Production of AAV serotype vectors is usually achieved through triple transfection of cells in culture with 3 plasmids, containing the recombinant AAV genome, or expressing AAV serotype genes or adenoviral helper functions, respectively. In an effort to improve this basic protocol, we have recently described a set of novel helper plasmids, expressing AAV serotype and adenoviral helper genes from a common background, and thus reducing the number of plasmids needed for vector generation to two (1 helper and 1 vector plasmid).

We established a simple and versatile in vitro method for screening the efficacy of DNA-based short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and identified a highly effective shRNA targeting basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a gene thought to play important roles in endogenous neuroprotective responses in the rat retina. We used two viral vectors, based on lentivirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV), to deliver shRNAs and silence bFGF in retinal pigment epithelial cells in vivo. The AAV experiments made use of a \u201cstabilized double-stranded\u201d version of these vectors with rapid onset of gene expression. In the rat retinal pigment epithelium, shRNAs delivered by either vector reduced bFGF immunoreactivity to undetectable levels in transduced cells, whereas a nonfunctional control construct incorporating a two-base pair mutation had no measurable effect on bFGF expression. Silencing commenced within a few days after injection of virus and remained stable throughout the period of observation, as long as 60 days. Viral delivery of RNAi constructs offers a powerful and versatile approach for both gene therapy and the analysis of fundamental questions in retinal biology."

More recently, the additional finding that the RNAi machinery and in particular miRNAs are fundamentally involved in pluripotency has sparked a flurry of efforts to develop new technologies for miRNA-regulated reprogramming of human cells. Here, we summarize and critically review the latest literature describing the three most prominent advances in this field, with a specific focus on the underlying methodologies and their clinical relevance. First, we compare the different experimentalapproaches\u2013forward versus reverse screening\u2013to identify endogenous miRNAs that are inherently involved in the induction and/or maintenance of pluripotency. Second, we comprehensively discuss the principal strategies for deliberate dysregulation of these miRNAs in order to reprogramme somatic cells that have been tested thus far, from viral vector-mediated miRNA expression along with classical pluripotency factors, to exclusive reprogramming through delivery of \u2018naked\u2019miRNAs. Third and last, we highlight novel innovative concepts that exploit the inherent alterations in miRNA expression profiles between pluripotent and differentiated cells, with the aim to mark and track these distinct subpopulations, or to purify one cell type from contaminations with the other. Finally, we conclude with our outlook into the possible future of human cell reprogramming and with suggestions for improvements to existing miRNA technologies that may further \u2026"

Its exciting looming clinical translation is particularly accelerated by the increasingly pursued juxtaposition of RNAi technologies with established gene therapy methodologies. Fostering this mutual attraction of two potent clinical modalities and paving the way to fully harness their therapeutic power are the abilities of viral gene transfer vectors to mediate stable, efficient and tailored transduction of RNAi into recipient cells.

In addition, a single intron sequence is found in the center of the genome, where the rep and cap orfs overlap. The AAV-2 rep gene encodes four closely related proteins (Rep proteins) with partially shared amino acid sequences. On the basis of their molecular weights, these proteins were designated Rep78, Rep68, Rep52 and Rep40. Unspliced and spliced transcripts originating from a promoter located at map unit 5 (p5) are translated into the two large Rep proteins, Rep78 and Rep68.

The typical helpervirus for AAV-2 is human Adenovirus type 2 or 5, but also Herpes simplex virus, Vaccinia virus and Cytomegalovirus can provide full helper functions.Analyses at the molecular level have shown that Adenovirus exerts its helper functions by inducing a strong expression of AAV-2 proteins.

These processes involve the transfer and resulting equilibrium distribution of one or more solutes between a fluid phase and particles. The partitioning of a single solute between fluid and sorbed phases or the selectivity of a sorbent towards multiple solutes makes it possible to separate solutes from a bulk fluid phase or from one another. This section treats batch and fixed-bed operations and reviews process cycles and equipment. As the processes indicate, fixed-bed operation with the sorbent in granule, bead, or pellet form is the predominant way of conducting sorption separations and purifications. Although the fixed-bed mode is highly useful, its analysis is complex. Therefore, fixed beds including chromatographic separations are given primary attention here with respect to both interpretation and prediction.Adsorption involves, in general, the accumulation (or depletion) of solute molecules at an interface (including gas-liquid interfaces, as in foam fractionation, and liquid-liquid interfaces, as in detergency). Here we consider only gas-solid and liquid-solid interfaces, with solute distributed selectively between the fluid and solid phases. The accumulation per unit surface area is small; thus, highly porous solids with very large internal area per unit volume are preferred. Adsorbent surfaces are often physically and/or chemically heterogeneous, and bonding energies may vary widely from one site to another. We seek to promote physical adsorption or \u2026"

The observed kinetic behavior of all the esterification reactions is found to follow a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism with competitive inhibition by both substrates. The effect of the chain-length of the fatty acids and the alcohols could be correlated to some mechanistic models, in accordance with the calculated kinetic parameters."

Both macroscopic methods (isocratic elution, gradient elution, batch adsorption, frontal analysis) and microscopic methods are considered. In all cases the main focus is the determination of the effective intraparticle diffusivity in order to permit a comparison of different stationary phases and provide a basis for predicting chromatographic process performance. Experimental results for representative systems are evaluated alongside the experimental and modeling aspects. Practical criteria for the selection of experimental conditions and the application of different models are discussed along with the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches."

The pore accessibility, determined by inverse size exclusion chromatography (iSEC) with dextran probes, decreases dramatically as a result of the combined effects of crosslinking, dextran grafting, and the introduction of ionic ligands, with pore radii decreasing from 19 nm for the base matrix to 6.1 nm for the 40 kDa dextran-grafted SP-matrix. In spite of this reduction, while the adsorption isotherms were similar, protein uptake rates were greatly increased with the dextran-grafted SP-matrices, compared to SP-matrices based on the short ligand \u2026"

The activity of the immobilized enzyme was maximum in a range of temperatures from 25 to 37\u00b0C. Ethylpropionate was formed from ethanol and propionic acid at a rate of 0.017 mol/h g immobilized protein. Different esters were formed at comparable rates and equilibrium conversions could generally be approached in less than 10 h in a batch reaction system. The immobilized lipase catalyst was quite stable and retained about one third of the initial activity after repeated experiments during the course of 72 days. A stirred tank continuous flow reactor was used successfully for the continuous production of esters."

The rates of uptake of the two amino acids have been determined experimentally for a closed batch system. The results of experiments in which the resin particle size, the flow rate, and the concentration were varied show that intraparticle transport is dominated by the slow diffusion of amino acid cations through the macroreticular polymer structure of the resin, with some contribution from macropore \u2026"

Being mechanically quite strong, they are suitable for chromatography applications at elevated mobile phase flow-rates. The uptake equilibrium of proteins by these ion exchangers is obtained experimentally and is found to follow the mass action law. Thus, reversible adsorption and desorption of proteins is obtained by varying the solution ionic strength. Batch mass transfer rates in an agitated contactor under favorable uptake conditions are also obtained. The uptake kinetics is controlled by the fluid phase mass transfer resistance for low protein concentrations, and by the intraparticle mass transfer resistance at high protein \u2026"

In all cases, the adsorption equilibrium capacity decreased with increasing salt. However, the adsorption kinetics was strongly influenced by the adsorbent structure and protein characteristics. For the smaller and positively charged lysozyme, the effective pore diffusivity was only weakly dependent on salt for the dextran-free media, but declined sharply with salt for the dextran-grafted materials. For this protein, the dextran grafts enhanced the adsorption kinetics at low salt, but the enhancement vanished at higher salt concentrations. For BSA, which was near its isoelectric point for the experimental conditions studied, the effective diffusivity was low for all materials and almost independent of \u2026"

The first one, BRX-Q, comprises a low-density gel with a matrix of denser polymeric aggregates. While this material has a very low size-exclusion limit for neutral probes, it exhibits an extremely high binding capacity for BSA. The second anion exchanger, BRX-QP, comprises large open pores but has a very low binding capacity. The cation exchanger, BRX-S, also comprises large open pores but exhibits an intermediate capacity; likely as a result of the presence of smaller pores.

The adsorbent materials investigated include both highly hydrophobic adsorbents as well as functionalized, more hydrophilic ones. The adsorption isotherms approach the ideal Langmuir form. For the amino acids considered in this work, the isotherms are essentially independent of pH, but they vary significantly with temperature and with the addition of alcohols. Heats of adsorption for phenylalamine are obtained from van't Hoff plots of the Henry's law constant limit of the Langmuir isotherm and they are found to be larger for the more hydrophobic adsorbents. However, adsorption affinities for this amino acid are larger for the more hydrophilic sorbents, indicating a significant entropic contribution for the adsorption on these materials."

The proteins lactalbumin, myoglobin, ovalbumin, BSA, conalbumin, IgG, and ferritin with molecular masses ranging from 15\u2008000 to 450\u2008000 were investigated. At high salt concentration (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl containing 500 mM NaCl), only the smaller proteins lactalbumin and myoglobin gained access to a significant portion of the particle volume. The larger proteins were nearly completely excluded, in agreement with the results obtained for neutral macromolecules. By contrast, at low salt concentration (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl), the adsorption capacity was very large (280\u2013400 mg/ml of particle volume) for all the proteins studied except for ferritin, for which the capacity was much lower. This suggests that, provided the solute is not too large, the favorable electrostatic interaction overcomes the size \u2026"

A model for linear chromatography is used in the analysis for particles that contain both throughpores where diffusive and convective transport occur and purely diffusive micropores. The key concept is that of a convection-augmented intraparticle diffusivity, which depends only on the intraparticle Peclet number, \u03bb. The separation performance is expressed in terms of both resolution and peak profiles at the column outlet. It is shown that, for given operating conditions, the separation enhancement obtained for intraparticle convection is dependent on the relative importance of throughpore and micropore diffusion rates. In the absence of micropore resistances, the resolution is always increased by intraparticle convection. The latter, however, is shown to have no \u2026"

Quantitative relationships are provided to relate the intraparticle flow to the permeability of the particles and the bed properties. A theoretical development focused on the response of the bed to pulse injections of inert and linearly sorbed solutes shows how intraparticle convection enhances intraparticle transport, improving the efficiency of chromatographic operations. The theory developed is consistent with experimental results obtained for low molecular weight solutes and proteins with a commercial large-pore support. For this system, the HETP is observed to increase linearly at low flow rates, leveling off to a plateau at high flow rates when intraparticle transport becomes dominated by convection."

Simultaneous diffusion and convection in the throughpores and diffusion in the microparticles are taken into account for slab-shaped and spherical pellets and expressions for the height equivalent to a theoretical plate are derived.

In this work, we present a local equilibrium model to predict the magnitude and duration of these pH transients. The model equations are solved by the method of characteristics and by numerical simulations using an equilibrium-dispersive model. By incorporating an explicit description of the dissociation of the weakly ionogenic groups in the resin, we show that counterion binding in the column can be predicted for different buffer systems based on a single experimental resin titration curve without having to resort to empirically defined adsorption equilibrium constants. Model predictions based on these assumptions are found to \u2026"

The solution dissociation equilibria of the amino acid and the solution composition determine the ionic fraction of amino acid cations in solution. In multicomponent systems, the uptake equilibrium is determined by the competitive interaction of the amino acid cations. A model that accounts for both solution andion-exchange equilibria is developed to correlate binary uptake dataand predict the uptake of amino acids in multicomponent systems.Ion-exchange resins are commonly used for the separa-tion of amino acids both on an analytical scale and in industrial manufacturing processes.

The uptakeof these solutes by the hydrogen form of the resins is shown to depend upon solution equilibria and ion exchange interactions and is found to occur essentially only through the exchange of amino acid or dipeptide cations for hydrogen ion. The selectivity coefficient for these exchange reactions is found to be related to the hydration of the resin and to the hydrophobic character of the exchanged solute. At low resin loadings with solute, the selectivity coefficient varies modestly with the degree of cross-linking of theresin but increases dramatically with the hydrophobicity of the solute. At higher resin-phase concentrations, on the other hand, steric interactions appear to be \u2026"

In agreement with experimental results, the model predicts practical, fairly linear gradients between pH 5 and 7, which are formed using suitable mixtures of acetate and phosphate buffers. The separation of mixtures of ovalbumin, albumin, and transferrin is used as a model system, but, unlike most previous work, we consider preparative conditions.

Size-exclusion and analytical anion-exchange chromatography are used to determine the relative amounts of monomer and dimer for two samples of BSA. While the amount of dimer was generally low, its impact on adsorptive behavior is significant. Equilibrium experiments demonstrate that the anion-exchange media binds the dimer more strongly, leading to an unequal distribution of the monomer and dimer between the two phases. Analysis of the breakthrough behavior of BSA reveals that the monomer breaks through prior to the dimer. This leads to the characteristic tailing breakthrough curve often seen with BSA. Breakthrough experiments carried out using dimer-free BSA confirm that the extreme tailing \u2026"

No selectivity between the different deamidated forms was seen at pH 5 for either stationary phase. However, although the binding strength was lower, both media exhibited substantial selectivity at pH 7.5. The effective binding charge, determined from linear gradient elution experiments and from the steric mass action model, was different for the two different media, but remained nearly the same for the different variants suggesting that the selectivity is determined by the strength of binding, rather than by the binding charge. This result agrees with the higher binding constants determined for the less deamidated forms. At low ionic strength \u2026"

The immobilized enzyme was effective in catalyzing the synthesis of ethylpropionate, isoamylpropionate, and isoamylbutyrate. With ethanol dissolved in hexane as a substrate, the maximum initial esterification rate was 0.02 mole/(h \u00d7 g of immobilized protein), but the enzyme was stable only when the substrate concentrations were lower than 0.2 m. With isoamyl alcohol in hexane as a substrate, esterification rates as high as 0.085 mole/(h \u00d7 g of immobilized protein) were observed and the immobilized enzyme was stable over a much broader concentration range. However, in this case, the use of a solvent, such as hexane, was not necessary for esterification, and the enzyme could be employed in equimolar acid/alcohol mixtures.

The product is a chiral alcohol, and it was desired to maintain a high enantiomeric excess. The effects of parameters such as the addition of a cosubstrate, water content, fermentation time, buffer pH, and bead diameter have been investigated. Such a general process may be quite useful when single enantiomers are needed, as well as for the production of other chemicals."

In this system, the water formed will partition between the catalyst and the medium. As the more polar reactants are converted into the less polar ester product, the water is partitioned more towards the biocatalyst and the accumulation of water eventually causes lower reaction rates. Addition of a strong\u2010acid cation exchange resin in sodium form is found to control the water accumulation on the biocatalyst without stripping the essential water needed for the enzyme to function and substantial improvements \u2026"

S-Sepharose, a strong-acid porous cation-exchange resin is used as the separation medium, and mixturesof albumin, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c are used as a model separation system. Equilibrium and mass-transfer parameters are developed for this system on the basis of fixed-bed chromatograph experiments. A mathematical model is then successfully used in conjunction with these parameters to simulate the performance of the CAC separations. The continuous separation performance of the annular apparatus is found to be essentially the same as the batchwise performance of an equivalent conventional chromatograph, making the unit attractive for preparative and process-scale applications where continuous throughput is desirable.Continuous annular chromatography (CAC) is \u2026"

The first step is relatively slow and rate determining; the second can be considered instantaneous. The penetration and the film theories for mass transfer with an autocatalytlc reaction have therefore been developed and the solution of the penetration theory has been found to bein qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

The effect is also dependent on the resin type, being prominent for the polymer-functionalized resin Fractogel EMD SO3\u2212 and virtually absent for a macroporous resin with similar backbone but no grafted polymers.

The adsorption kinetics for the macroporous matrix was found to be controlled largely by pore diffusion. The effective diffusivity estimated from single component data was a fraction of the mAb free solution diffusivity, and its value could be used to accurately predict the adsorption kinetics for two- and three-component systems. In this case, when two or more variants were adsorbed simultaneously, both experimental and predicted results showed a temporary overshoot of the amount adsorbed above the equilibrium value for the more deamidated variant followed by a gradual approach to equilibrium.

In general, uptake curves calculated with this new approximation compare favorably with the numerical solution of the adsorption\u2013diffusion equation in spherical coordinates producing results of accuracy similar to that obtained when the LDF approximation is used for systems with a constant diffusivity."

The characteristic pore sizes, determined by inverse size exclusion chromatography, were about 140 nm for UNOsphere S, and only about 10 nm for Nuvia S, indicating that the polymeric extenders occupy a substantial portion of the base matrix pores. Greater exclusion limits were found for Nuvia S in 1 M NaCl and for a similar matrix containing uncharged surface extenders, suggesting that the polymeric extenders collapse partially at high ionic strength or when they are uncharged. Large equilibrium binding capacities were obtained for Nuvia S, approaching 320 \u00b1 10 \u2026"

The adsorbent medium, known as S-HyperD, comprises polystyrene-coated silica particles whose pores are filled with a functionalized poly(acrylamide)-based hydrogel. The equilibrium uptake decreases gradually with salt concentration in the range 0\u2212150 mM, and no uptake occurs at concentrations of 300 mM or greater. In the low salt range, the rates are consistent with a homogeneous diffusion model where the driving force is the bound protein concentration gradient. As a result of highly favorable partitioning in the gel, transport rates are higher than predicted for diffusion in liquid-filled pores. At high salt concentrations, the measured rates are still consistent with the model, but the diffusivity is higher. In all cases, intraparticle transport is independent of hydrodynamics.

Because of the mathematical complexities associated with an exact description of intraparticle digitsion in spherical sorbent particles, approximate expressions are desirable. The most widely used approximation is the Glueckauf linear driving force (LDF) approximation (Glueckauf, 1955): ag T&j= WY.-P).(1)Here 1 is the average dimensionless concentration of the adsorbed species in the sorbent particle and yT the concentration at the particle surface.

Experimental data are obtained for the proteins lysozyme and albumin with a commercial agarose-based cation exchanger. Sharp rings are observed in both cases confirming that protein mass transfer within the particles occurs via a shell-progressive diffusion mechanism.

Two peaks are obtained when the bound protein is eluted with either a NaCl gradient or with two NaCl steps at increasing concentration. The first, early eluting peak contains only monomeric species whose structure is consistent with the native monomer. The second, late eluting peak contains a mixture of monomeric and aggregated species. The monomeric species in this mixture is also found to have a structure consistent with that of the native mAb, showing no evidence of increased solvent exposure.

The reaction is equilibrium limited, and accumulation of water on the biocatalyst causes a reduction in biocatalytic activity. As a result simultaneous removal of water by adsorption on a catalytically inert ion-exchange resin in Na form has been used to improve conversion. A three-zone SMBR system was developed for this purpose integrating reaction, adsorption, and regeneration. The packed beds in the three zones are periodically advanced in a \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d fashion to simulate countercurrent flow. The SMBR allows continuous operation while reducing desorbent consumption and improving conversion relative to a conventional fixed-bed reactor.

Analogs of lovastatin having a different side chain were also obtained through this method by reacting the diol substrate with different carboxylic acids. The selection of reaction conditions that maximize the initial reaction rate is investigated. Since the diol substrate has very low solubility in non\u2010polar solvents, reaction solvents consisting of mixtures of hexane with a different, more polar cosolvent are considered. For each of the cosolvent mixtures studied, the reaction rate is maximum for an intermediate percentage of cosolvent in hexane.

Dextran standards, proteins, and virus-like particles (VLPs) show size-exclusion behavior consistent with such a bimodal distribution of pore sizes. For non-binding conditions, the trends in height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) as a function of mobile phase velocity and molecular size are consistent with perfusion suggesting that a fraction of the mobile phase between 0.0005 and 0.0008 flows through the particles. This small fraction provides little or no enhancement of intraparticle mass transfer for relatively small proteins (lysozyme and IgG) even at 1000 cm/h, but can \u2026"

The feed mixture which is to be separated is continuously introduced at a stationary point at the top of the bed, while eluent flows over the remainder of the annulus. The rotation of the sorbent bed coupled with the elution development induced by the downflow of eluent causes the feed components to appear as individual helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point. The separation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, using the calcium form of a cation\u2010exchange resin, was investigated using water as the eluent. Experiments were carried out both with a synthetic mixture of the sugars as well as with an industrial feedstock. The separation was explored first in a bench\u2010scale conventional fixed \u2026"

Partition coefficients were obtained by measuring the fluorescence intensity in the gel-filled capillaries equilibrated with dilute solutions of each probe. The partition coefficients show an exponential decay with gel concentration in agreement with the Ogston model for partitioning in fibrous gels. Comparison of the data for 10 kDa dextran with this model yields fiber radii of 0.79 and 0.99 nm for the anionic and the cationic gels, respectively, which are similar in magnitude \u2026"

A ray-theoretic approach is first used to predict the behavior of light traveling through a particle during transient protein adsorption. When the protein concentration gradient in the particle is sharp, resulting in a steep refractive index gradient, the rays bend and intersect, thereby concentrating light in a sharp ring that marks the position of the adsorption front. This behavior is observed when mass transfer is dominated by pore diffusion and the adsorption isotherm is highly favorable. Applications to protein cation-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and affinity adsorption are then considered using, as examples, the three commercial, agarose-based stationary phases SP-Sepharose-FF, Butyl \u2026"

The effect of reactant partitioning on the initial rate of the reactions is also investigated. The observed initial rates are found to vary inversely with reactant partitioning between the organic solvent and the biocatalyst beads. A kinetic model is developed to describe the initial reaction rate of hexanone reduction as a function of substrate concentration within the alginate beads."

Desorption in a shallow-bed contactor with NaOH concentrations in the range of 50-200 mM is shownto occur in the absence of equilibrium limitations and of external mass-transfer resistance. For these con-ditions, the desorption rate is controlled by the slow diffusion of amino acid or peptide cations, which appears to be severely hindered in thecross-linked polymer mesh of the resins.

Even with buffered solutions, however, unintended pH transients can occur when the salt concentration varies. For example, the pH temporarily decreases below the feed value when the salt concentration increases and increases above the feed value when the salt concentration is decreased. The intensity and duration of these transients depend on the particular buffer used and the magnitude of the salt concentration step, but in extreme cases the pH can drop by as much as 1.5 pH units creating conditions where the HAP stability is potentially compromised.

In most cases, the data are adequately described by assuming that hindered diffusion in liquid-filled pores is the controlling mass transfer mechanism. For these adsorbents, the ratio of particle porosity and tortuosity factor is found to be essentially constant as a function of temperature and composition of the liquid phase. The tortuosity factors are somewhat larger for the smaller pore materials than for the larger-pore ones. However, in the case of a nearly microporous adsorbent, the diffusivity appears to be dependent on temperature to an extent which is not consistent with the assumption of diffusion in rigid, liquid-filled pores."

Although approximate mechanistic models are available, they do not always have the accuracy needed for precise predictions. The aim of this work is to develop a method to predict protein chromatographic behavior from batch isotherm data without relying on a mechanistic model. The method uses a systematic empirical interpolation (EI) scheme coupled with a lumped kinetic model with rate parameters determined from HETP measurements for non\u2010binding conditions, to numerically predict the column behavior. For two experimental systems considered in this work, predictions based on the EI scheme are in excellent agreement with experimental elution profiles under highly overloaded conditions without using any adjustable parameters.

At high protein loads and strong binding conditions (0\u201360 mM NaCl), the selectivity in the same buffer is near unity with no NaCl added, but increases gradually with salt concentration reaching high values between 2 and 15 with 60 mM added NaCl.

In this process, a mixture of monomer and dimer is continuously fed to the column under conditions where the mixture is favorably bound, resulting in two breakthrough fronts whose monomer and dimer compositions are determined by the multi-component equilibrium and kinetics of the system. Experimentally, the selectivity for dimer was found to vary substantially with ionic strength, being lowest when conditions favor the strongest binding, and increasing to a maximum at intermediate ionic strengths where rapid exchange with the bound monomer can occur.

Such particles, containing large connected pores, allow a significant level of forced intraparticle convection. Although this intraparticle convective flow is often only a small fraction of the total flow, in some cases it is sufficient to enhance the overall rate of intraparticle transport of solutes increasing the efficiency of diffusion-limited operations. In liquid chromatography, such conditions are typically found for particles having pores larger than 100 nm, with slowly diffusing solutes, such as proteins, and at high flow rates of the mobile \u2026"

Introduction of a step in eluent concentration, however, permitted a much more efficient separation of the two metals. Separation of Fe3+ and Cr3+remained nearly complete but elution of the more strongly retained species (Cr3+) occurred over a much narrower angle and dilution of the product streams was significantly reduced or even eliminated in some cases. A theoretical model was developed to describe the operation of the continuous annular chromatograph with step elution.

Model results are presented in dimensionless form for isotherms ranging from highly favorable to nearly linear. When the isotherm is highly favorable, operating with 2 to 3 columns in series reduces the amount of adsorbent needed by 15 to 35% when the process is operated with a rapid cycle. Smaller improvements are predicted for longer cycles, while larger improvements are predicted when the isotherm is less favorable.

A model for ion-exchange equilibrium which takes into account heterogeneity of functional groups on the resins was found to provide an excellent correlation of binary data. The model was successfully extended to the prediction of multicomponent equilibria utilizing solely parameters determined from binary measurements. In this work an equilibrium stage model which takes into account solution and ion-exchange equilibria is presented to predict the performance of fixed-bed separation processes. The model requires only equilibrium data an provides and approximate representation of the dynamic behavior, which is in agreement with experimental observations."

The reactions were conducted using 2\u2010propanol as a sacrificial substrate to regenerate the cofactor NAD(H), and a mixture of (S)\u2010 and (R)\u2010alcohols was produced. The use of strictly aerobic conditions when growing the cells resulted in the highest initial reaction rates, as well as the production of only a single product (i.e., the enantiomeric excess of the (S)\u2010alcohols was 1.0). However, initial reaction rates decreased proportionally with fermentation time regardless of whether the yeast were grown aerobically or under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The data also suggest that it is the aerobic (or anaerobic) condition, rather than the cell growth phase, which is responsible for the results seen."

Molecular dynamics simulation is used to determine protein diffusion and partitioning in different regions of the adsorbent pore, and these outputs are used in numerical simulations of mass transfer to determine the intraparticle protein concentration profile and the mass\u2010transfer rate. Modeling results indicate that, consistent with experimental observations, protein transport can be faster in the polymer\u2010grafted material compared to the open pore case.

The pH temporarily decreases before gradually returning to the feed value when the salt concentration increases, potentially compromising the stability of the HAP when either the magnitude or duration of the pH drop is excessive. The opposite happens when the salt concentration decreases. In this work we address the effects of several key variables: the flow rate, the particle size, the use of salt gradients instead of steps, the use of different co-buffers, the surface area of the HAP, and the use of a slightly alkaline wash prior to increasing the salt concentration. Flow rate and particle size were found to have virtually no effect, demonstrating that the pH transitions are equilibrium rather than kinetically driven. Salt gradients resulted \u2026"

The results are consistent with a model that assumes a linear relationship between bed compression and relative flow velocity. Surprisingly, the packing compressibility is essentially independent of column diameter for the preparative columns. As a result, after accounting for the variation in extraparticle porosity caused by compression, the column pressure drop is accurately predictable using the Carman\u2013Kozeny equation.

The model is restricted to linear isotherms and treats mass transfer effects with the linear driving force approximation. The solution is obtained for periodic, rectangular feed pulses, with an arbitrary gradient shape and type, and is given in the form of a convergent series that allows a direct calculation of the effluent profile and of the average product concentration. Calculations for small feed pulses, show that the solution gives the retention time and peak spreading predicted by the linear solvent strength theory for reversed phase chromatography, in the limit of Gaussian peaks. For larger feed pulses the solution predicts asymmetric peaks with concentrations exceeding that of the feed sample. The theory developed is succesfully used to predict volume overload effects in gradient elution from isocratic elution data \u2026"

Two peaks are observed without a hold step while a third more strongly retained peak becomes noticeable with a hold time as low as 10 min. As the hold time is increased further, the first peak gradually disappears, the second peak initially increases and then decreases, and the third peak continuously increases. Dynamic light scattering shows that the third peak contains significant levels of aggregates formed in the column. Circular dichroism, HX-MS analyses of the eluted fraction, in-line fluorescence detection, and bound-state HX-MS analysis indicate that the aggregates derive from an unfolded intermediate that is slowly formed while the protein is bound to the resin. Aggregate formation does not occur on a different CEX resin, Nuvia HR-S, with similar particle size but \u2026"

Dynamic light scattering shows that there is no significant effect of the counterion type on the mAb aqueous diffusivity. The counterion type also does not affect substantially the structure of the polymer grafts, nor does it affect the stoichiometry of the protein ion exchange process. While no counterion effects are also observed on the protein mass transfer kinetics for the macroporous matrix, very large effects are seen for the polymer grafted matrices with protein adsorption rates increasing dramatically in the order Ca++ > Arg+ > Na+ > TBAH+.

The equilibrium uptake is found to be relatively insensitive to temperature, particularly at high amino acid loadings on the resin. However, mass transfer rates for conditions where the intraparticle resistance is dominant are found to increase substantially as temperature is increased, with the effect being more pronounced for resins of higher degree of crosslinking. Intraparticle diffusivities are obtained from alkaline desorption experiments, while external film mass transfer coefficients in an agitated contactor are obtained from the rates of amino acid uptake from a dilute solution. Intraparticle diffusivities are strongly dependent on the hydration water of the resin and they increase substantially as temperature is increased."

Next, high\u2010throughput batch isotherm data are collected for a monoclonal antibody on the cation exchange resin POROS XS over a range of protein concentrations, salt concentrations, and solution pH. Finally, a previously developed empirical interpolation (EI) method is extended to describe protein binding as a function of the protein and salt concentration and solution pH without using an explicit isotherm model.

An exact analytic solution is found for the case of homovalent exchange and an approximate solution for the case of heterovalent exchange. Results obtained from the exact solution of the Nernst-Planck model are compared to those obtained using the film-model approximation for the case of ternary exchange in infinite-batch and fixed-bed systems. The predictions based on the film-model approximation are in good agreement with the exact solution for both homovalent and heterovalent ion exchange, indicating that the film-model approximation can be used effectively in numerical simulations of complex ion-exchange systems."

Molecular dynamics simulations show that protein partitioning into the polymer-filled pore space increases with the overall charge content of the polymers, while the diffusivity in the pore space decreases. However, the combination of greatly increased partitioning and modestly decreased diffusion results in macroscopic transport rates that increase as a function of charge content, as the large concentration driving force due to enhanced pore space partitioning outweighs the reduction in the pore space diffusivity. Matrices having greater charge associated with the grafted polymers also exhibit more diffuse intraparticle concentration profiles during transient adsorption. In systems with a \u2026"

The solution is used to define the effective rate coefficient, K, for the linear driving force (LDF) approximation for cyclic adsorption and desorption. The results obtained differ from those previously derived using an equivalent solid diffusion model for the pellet with a single diffusional time constant, approaching this limit only when macropore diffusion is dominant. In fact, for rapid-cycling the mass transfer rate cannot be expressed in the terms of a simple linear combination of the diffusional time constants for the bidisperse pellet independent of cycle time. Thus, in this case, the exact solution must be used to arrive at an appropriate representation of mass transfer rates in cyclic adsorption, which can be used for the simulation of sportive separations."

For low reaction rates, the two components behave independently and two separate peaks are obtained when an equilibrium mixture is injected. At intermediate reaction rates, the elution profiles are stretched between the characteristic elution times of the two components. Finally, at high reaction rates, the two components propagate through the column as an equilibrium mixture and two superimposed symmetrical peaks are obtained.

Beyond individual presentations and topics of novel interest, a substantial portion of the Workshop was devoted toward group discussions of current states and future directions in modeling fields. All scales of modeling, from biophysical models at the molecular level and up through large scale facility and plant modeling, were considered in these discussions and are summarized in the manuscript.

The rate expression approximates the electric field effects on intraparticle diffusion in spherical ion-exchangers. With regard to the prediction of batch exchange and column breakthrough curves for both irreversible and reversible processes, the model captures the essential traits of the coupled diffusion phenomenon described by the Nernst\u2013Planck equation with results of accuracy comparable to that obtained when using the linear driving force approximation for systems with constant diffusivity. Numerical results for the exchange of two counterions of equal valence are presented as application examples for different mobility ratios and selectivity coefficients."

For both resins, elution with a salt gradient results in multiple peaks for each of the three BiSAb molecules at short residence times. The peaks gradually merge into two peaks and then into one peak eluting at intermediate salt concentrations when the residence time is gradually increased. Re-injecting fractions of each the individual peaks obtained at short residence time results in nearly the same multiple peak elution pattern. This behavior, which is contrary to the behavior normally encountered in ion exchange chromatography, appears to be related to the reversible, surface -catalyzed interconversion between different conformational states of each BiSAb \u2026"

In general, an increase in salt concentration drives protein partitioning to the hydrophobic surface while a decrease reduces it. In some cases, however, protein retention also increases at low salt concentrations resulting in a U-shaped retention factor curve. During gradient elution the salt concentration is gradually decreased from a high value thereby reducing the retention factor and increasing the protein chromatographic velocity. For these conditions, a steep gradient can overtake the protein in the column, causing it to rebind. Two dynamic models, one based on the local equilibrium theory and the other based on the linear driving force approximation, are presented. We show that the normalized gradient slope determines whether the protein elutes in the \u2026"

The rotation of the sorbent bed coupled with the simultaneous elution chromatography causes the separated components of the feed stream to appear as helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point.The separation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, using the calcium form of cationic ion exchange resin, uses water as the isocratic eluent.

A phenomenological model was developed assuming that the BiSAb molecules exist in multiple configurations that interact differently with the resin surface and interconvert at finite rates. In Part II of this work we provide relevant biomolecular perspectives that shed light on the underlying mechanisms. Firstly, we show that crosslinking the BiSAb molecules with a bifunctional reagent, which limits conformational flexibility, suppresses multiple peak elution. Secondly, we show that of the fragments obtained by enzymatic digestion of the BiSAb molecules only those that exhibit a pair of scFv \u2026"

I4 In these permeable supports, in fact, intraparticle transport of solutes occurs as a result of two mechanisms: molecular diffusion and intraparticle convection, which is generated by the pressure gradient across the particle in a chromatographic column. Two models have been presented in the literature to describe transient diffusion and forced convection within permeable particles. The two models are shown in Figure 1. In the first case, Figure la, the particles are assumed to have the geometry of a slab with thickness 2e. Intraparticle flow is assumed to be uniform along the z axis, and both faces of \u2026"

The simulations illustrate that to achieve fast adsorption kinetics, there is a tradeoff between favorable binding \u2026"

                "abstract": "Separating mixtures of \u03b1\u2010amino butyric acid (ABA) and isoleucine (Ile) by displacement chromatography with a cation exchange resin and an alkaline displacer leads to the formation of a displacement train, in which only ABA is recovered as a pure component, while Ile is recovered in a mixed band with ABA. The purity of the Ile band depends on the concentration of the displacer, and essentially pure Ile is obtained when the displacer concentration is reduced to a low value. The observed behavior is explained by considering the nonideality of the equilibrium uptake of these amino acids by the resin. An equilibrium model, representing the pure component isotherms, predicts variable selectivity and the occurrence of selectivity reversal in the two\u2010component system. Analyses using this model based on the theory of coherent waves and a numerical solution of the conservation equations for the displacement \u2026"

Confocal laser scanning microscopy measurements revealed that binding of the large protein was extremely slow and eventually stopped completely after the adsorption front penetrated just a few \u03bcm into the particle. Binding capacities after 24\u2009h of incubation were nevertheless around 35\u2009mg/mL of particle which is relatively high when considering that only a fraction of the particle was saturated, suggesting that locally-high bound protein concentrations are attained in a layer close to the particle \u2026"

Two commercial C18 silica packings are used, one irregular and one spherical and monodispersed. For each packing, the relationship between mobile phase flow-rate, column backpressure, and radial compression pressure is determined. A model is proposed to explain this relationship and determine the radial compression pressure needed to maintain the column effectively compressed at each operating flow-rate. The chromatographic efficiency of these columns is also determined. When an adequate radial compression level is used, the efficiency of the preparative-scale system is nearly the same as that of analytical-scale columns. Applying incremental levels of radial compression can also lead to a restoration of the efficiency of columns whose performance was degraded by operation at low \u2026"

Both resins are agarose-based and contain an adsorbing core surrounded by an inert shell. Although shell thicknesses are comparable (3.6 and 4.2 \u00b5m for Capto Core 400 and 700, respectively), the two resins differ substantially in pore size (pore radii of 19 and 50 nm, respectively). Because of the smaller pores and higher surface area, the BSA binding capacity of Capto Core 400 is approximately double that of Capto Core 700. However, for the much larger Tg, the attainable capacity is substantially larger for Capto Core 700. Mass transfer in both resins is affected by diffusional resistances \u2026"

Multiple columns are distributed among the four zones in different simulated countercurrent schemes, including a scheme that allows recycling of excess desorbent and another where the lysine recovery yield is enhanced at low flow rates by lowering the pH in the last column of the adsorption zone.

                "abstract": "An approximate rate equation based on a film-model representation of diffusional mass transfer has been developed to describe the kinetics of multicomponent adsorption. The model describes mass transfer as a pseudo-steady state diffusion process through a flat film of thickness equal to one fifth of the particle radius. The flux relationships are integrated across the film yielding analytical expressions for the rate of mass transfer in a multicomponent adsorption system. The usefulness of the film model approximation is tested by carrying out calculations for three different practical adsorption systems: the adsorption of n-pentane and n-heptane mixtures on NaCaA zeolite discussed by Marutovsky and B\u00fclow (1987); the adsorption of air in molecular sieve RS-10 discussed by Farooq et al. (1993); and the separation of air in a kinetically-controlled nitrogen PSA process discussed by Farooq and Ruthven (1990 \u2026"

For practical conditions, while axial dispersion has only a small impact on the breakthrough curve, radial flow nonuniformity has a profound effect. Radial parabolic velocity profiles lead to tailing tracer peaks and broader breakthrough curves. Profiles where the velocity varies radially only in a thin region near the column wall lead to fronting tracer peaks and early breakthrough when the velocity at the wall is higher than the average and to tailing peaks and tailing breakthrough curves when the velocity at the wall is lower than the average. Experiments conducted in laboratory minicolumns (0.5\u20131 cm diameter, 0.5\u20131 ml volume) show tracer peaks and protein \u2026"

In the absence of urea, apoA\u2010IM was highly associated and existed primarily as a mixture of homodimer, tetramer and hexamer forms. Under these conditions, since the binding strength was greater for the oligomer forms, broad, asymmetrical peaks were obtained in both isocratic and gradient elution. Adding urea depressed self\u2010association and caused unfolding. This resulted in sharper peaks but also decreased the binding strength.

Protein load and gradient slope affect both elution peak shape and protein recovery during the gradient. Higher protein loads result in tailing peaks with near 100% recovery that transition to fronting peaks and incomplete recovery as the protein load is reduced.

In agreement with the experiments, the model predicts increasingly skewed elution peaks and lower resolution as the protein load increases. However, even at loadings as high as 50% of the column protein binding capacity, high-purity fractions could be collected along the induced pH gradient demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the mixed-bed system."

At high salt where no protein binding occurs and without urea, mass transfer was controlled by hindered pore diffusion of multiple associated forms for both materials.

As a consequence, the effective diffusivity decreased as urea was added and was greater for the larger pore Macro\u2010Prep\u2010HQ resin. At low salt, under strong binding conditions, the adsorption kinetics followed a more complex mechanism. In this case, the kinetics was very slow for both stationary phases up to 2 M urea.

Previous work has demonstrated the utility of this technology for the separation of various materials by isocratic elution on a bench scale. Novel applications and improved operation of the process were studied in this work, demonstrating that CAC is a versatile apparatus which is capable of separations at high throughput. Three specific separation systems were investigated. Pilot-scale separations at high loadings were performed using an industrial sugar mixture as an example of scale-up for isocratic separations. Bench-scale experiments of a low concentration metal ion mixture were performed to demonstrate stepwise elution, a chromatographic technique which decreases dilution and increases sorbent capacity. Finally, the separation of mixtures of amino acids by ion exchange was investigated to demonstrate the use of displacement development on the CAC. This technique, which perhaps has the most potential, when applied to the CAC allowed simultaneous separation and concentration of multicomponent mixtures on a continuous basis. Mathematical models were developed to describe the CAC performance and optimize the operating conditions. For all the systems investigated, the continuous separation performance of the CAC was found to be very nearly the same as the batchwise performance of conventional chromatography. the technology appears, thus, to be very promising for industrial applications. 43 figs., 9 tabs."

The apparatus uses a slowly rotating annular bed of sorbent material.

The rotation of the sorbent bed coupled with down-flow of eluent and Sorption, causes the separated components of the feed to form helical bands, which appear at the bottom of the annular bed at characteristic, stationary exit points.

By applying a coordinate transformation, the model is solved analytically using the Laplace transform approach. The moment generating property of the Laplace domain solution is used to derive analytical expressions for the first three moments of the response to rectangular injections. These moments are instructive for analyzing the retention time, band broadening and asymmetry of elution profiles. Compared to isocratic elution, the derivation of analytical solutions and moments for gradient elution is more complicated, because the retention behavior of the solutes depends on the varying mobile phase modulator. Several case studies are evaluated theoretically. To gain confidence on the derived analytical results, a high-resolution finite volume \u2026"

The binding capacity and selectivity are dependent on the CHT type and salt concentration. While the rate of protein adsorption on CHT Type I is slow and controlled largely by pore diffusion resulting in relatively poor separation, adsorption on CHT Type II is much faster and better separation is obtained than with Type I. However, comparison with predictions based on pore diffusion alone, reveals the presence of additional resistances associated with adsorption and displacement kinetics. A spreading kinetics model assuming multiple binding configurations coupled with pore diffusion was developed to describe these effects and found to be in quantitative agreement with the frontal analysis results and able to predict the separation \u2026"

The level of protection against digestion was independent of the PEG molecular weight or modification extent for the PEGylation chemistry used.

In this work we simulate intraparticle adsorption profiles during batch adsorption assuming typical process conditions for pore, solid and parallel diffusion.

Typical sharp fronts for pore diffusion are characteristic for Langmuir equilibrium constants of KL \u22651. Only at KL = 0.1 and lower, the profiles are smooth and practically indistinguishable from a solid diffusion mechanism. During hold and wash steps, at which the interstitial buffer is removed or exchanged, continuation of diffusion of protein molecules is significant for solid diffusion due to the adsorbed phase concentration driving force. For pore diffusion, protein mobility is considerable at low and moderate binding \u2026"

The mean ratio of the predicted value over the exact value of the displacement ductility demand is computed and plotted as a function of the vibration period of the oscillator for different values of the yield acceleration. The results show that, whatever the oscillator and the earthquake, the rigidplastic method leads to a generally conservative estimate of the inelastic displacement demand. Mean errors less than 15% are found both for comparatively short-period oscillators and for comparatively long-period oscillators. For medium-period oscillators, the relative mean error is generally less than 30%, even for very high levels of ductility demand. Some advantages of the rigid-plastic method with respect to other approximate methods are also discussed in the paper."

Furthermore, the simple differential equation of motion derived from this correction is proven to give an adequate estimate of the transient response of a bar under dynamic excitation.The advantages of the present formulation over other existing theories are twofold. Firstly, it can be applied to bars of any cross-section. Secondly, and more importantly, its treatment is straightforward and its results \u2013 like the dispersion relation and the differential equation of motion it provides \u2013 are easy to use in practical applications."

Experimental data are obtained in a 1cm diameter laboratory column and in preparative scale columns with diameters of 20, 30, and 45cm. The results are consistent with a model that assumes a linear relationship between bed compression and relative flow velocity. Surprisingly, the packing compressibility is essentially independent of column diameter for the preparative columns. As a result, after accounting for the variation in extraparticle porosity caused by compression, the column pressure drop is accurately predictable using the Carman\u2013Kozeny equation. A model is also developed to predict productivity for IgG capture as a function of operating conditions based on dynamic binding capacity data presented in Part I of this work. For typical conditions, the model predicts maximum productivity at low residence times, between 1 and 1.5min, when the dynamic binding capacity is at about 70\u201380% of the maximum. Combining the two models for column pressure and for dynamic binding capacity allows the design of preparative scale columns that maximize productivity while meeting specified pressure constraints."

Ultimately, our goal in chemical process design should be closed-loop systems with zero emission to the environment, but this goal, of course, has to be balanced against economic factors and other constraints that would normally be encountered in practical situations. This can only come about through the education and training of scientists and engineers who can implement technological advances in designs that integrate regulatory and environmental considerations with the goal of economic development within the constraints of an industrial operation.A new course,\" Process Integration and Industrial Pollution Prevention,\" was recently developed at the University of Virginia with the assistance of several experts and with the participation of a company sponsor.

The phenomenon, which is common to a number of industrial gas-liquid and liquid-liquid contacting operations, proceeds through a moving boundary mechanism. The reaction between a chemical species present in the drop and a second reactant species diffusing into the drop from a surrounding continuous phase occurs at a reaction front that progressively recedes away from the surface of the drop toward its center. While in their analysis Dutta et al. neglected the mass-transfer resistance in the continuous phase, its effects are shown here to be quite significant in many situations of practical importance, particularly during the initial stage of contact between phases."

Comparative chromatographic separation studies have also been conducted for the system using a conventional fixed-bed column packed with the same resin. Complete resolution of fructose-glucose mixtures could be obtained both in a 60 cm-long continuous annular chromatograph and in a conventional column of the same length with sugars feed concentration up to 200 g/L. In the four-component mixture blue dextran (higher molecular weight saccharide), sucrose, glucose and fructose complete rsolution of all species except sucrose-glucose under the relatively mild separating conditions tested. The experimental results have been analyzed in terms of approximate linear chromatographic theories for fixed and rotating beds. Bed properties and equilibrium and mass transfer parameters used in the model were obtained through independent experiments. With these parameters a good fit to the experimental results was obtained. Differences in feed mixtures and dispersion characteristics contribute to the minor offset between fixed bed and continuous chromatograph results. 21 refs., 12 figs., 3 tabs."

Negatively charged latex nanoparticles (NPs) with nominal diameters of 20, 40, and 100 nm are also studied as surrogates for bioparticles. Protein binding and its trends with respect to salt concentration depend on the protein size and are different for the two agarose\u2010based multimodal resins. For the smaller proteins, the amount of protein bound over practical time scales is limited by the resin surface area and is larger for Capto Core 400 compared to Capto Core 700. For the larger proteins, diffusion is severely restricted in Capto Core 400, resulting in lower binding capacities \u2026"

The two components are assumed to have the same binding capacity without the possibility of displacement of one component by the other but with different effective pore diffusivities. As a result, the amounts of each component adsorbed depend on the relative rates of mass transfer within the particles. Closed-form analytical expressions derived by solving the relevant conservation equations are obtained to describe adsorption from an infinite bath with constant concentrations at the particle surface, batch adsorption in a finite bath, and adsorption in packed columns, both under constant pattern and non-constant pattern conditions. In each case, the expression derived reduces to a single integral. These expressions are in good agreement with \u2026"

In this study a method to monitor and quantify the interaction of RNA with yeast\u2010expressed human papillomavirus (HPV) VLPs using biolayer interferometry (BLI) is developed. Both biosensors with immobilized VLPs as well as biosensors with immobilized RNA are tested. Two types of recombinantly expressed HPV VLPs are used, Type 18 and Type 11. The data show that yeast whole cell RNA associates with Type 18 but not with Type 11 (maximum binding signal of 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u2009nm on immobilized VLP probes for Type 18 vs. 0.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u2009nm for Type 11).

                "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a serious problem related to not only a variety of human diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and prion disease, but also to the biopharmaceutical industry. The destabilization and aggregation of one variant of the homodimer human superoxide dismutase-1 (hSOD1), in which the alanine at the 4 th residue is substituted with valine (hSOD1 A4V), is believed to result in most of the cases of familiar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) in North America. In this work, an introdomain steric clash between Val4 and Phe20 was first found in a structure generated with A4V sequence on a wild type hSOD1 backbone by using a computational protein design program RosettaDesign. We hypothesized the introdomain steric clash between Val4 and Phe20 should be responsible for the destabilization and aggregation propensity of the hSOD1 A4V variant. We chose to test this hypothesis two steps further in a collaboration with the Kwon lab: 1) by using RosettaDesign and rational design approaches to identify residues which could relieve the clash caused by the inserted valine, 2) by testing variants in vitro and in cultured cells. Consequently, two second-site mutations at the 20 th residue of hSOD1 A4V molecule were shown to alleviate the adverse effects caused by the A4V mutation both in vitro and in vivo. were performed in this work, the results strongly supported our hypothesis that the introdomain clash between Val4 and Phe is the actual cause of the destabilization of hSOD1 A4V variant. The strategy performed in this work can be used as a potential generalized method to help reveal the cause of other mutant protein \u2026"

These materials combining the desirable characteristics of a soft, hydrophilic polymer with those of a rigid support matrix allowing operation at high flow rates of the mobile phase. Compared to macroporous matrices without grafted polymers, these composite materials exhibit higher binding capacity and fast adsorption kinetics, making them ideal for capture from dilute protein solutions. For these conditions, very sharp breakthrough curves can be obtained, approaching local equilibrium. Separation of protein mixtures at high loads is also important, particularly with regards to the resolution of protein charge variants. In this work, we compare the single and multicomponent adsorption kinetics of antibody charge variants on macroporous and polymer-grafted cation exchangers and develop models to predict chromatographic performance for capture and separation by frontal analysis. A pore diffusion model taking into account competitive adsorption of the charge variants is found to predict the behavior of macroporous matrices, whose pore size is much larger than the size of the proteins. A new model is needed, however, to describe multicomponent protein adsorption in polymer grafted media. In this case, the grafted polymers prevent adsorbed protein molecules from passing each other as the diffuse in the stationary phase. Thus, a new single file diffusion (SFD) model is developed for this case. In agreement with experimental data, the SFD model predict fast mass transfer for single component and \u2026"

The prestress in that segment may be due to some distortion forces acting upon the bar. The end surfaces of the segment act as discontinuity surfaces inside the medium. They partially reflect and partially transmit any pressure wave impinging on them. It is found that the coefficients of reflection and transmission are functions both of the prestress of the segment and of the frequency of the wave. This produces a prestress-induced dispersion-like phenomenon, which in principle should be capable of revealing the state of internal stress of the body."

DIMON SK-1B was used as an example of cation exchange resin, which has 8% of DVB content. L-lysine dissociation constants, ion exchange equilibrium constants and intraparticle diffusivities were measured at 25 degrees C. These fundamental parameters were applied for multicolumn simulation. All calculated results were obtained for a column of 1.5 cm phi X 10 cm and switching time of 3600 s. 1. In the case of single-column adsorption, L-lysine leakage in the adsorption train was observed at a feed rate of 5.7 X 10 (-2) mol/h of L-lysine when monovalent lysine solution was fed to the multicolumn system. Two-and three-column adsorption systems showed L-lysine leakage at feed rates of 1.2 x10 (-1) mol/h and 1.4 X 10 (-1) mol/h of L-lysine, respectively. Thus, the increase of column number from 1 to 2 was effective for prevention of the leakage, while the increase of column number from 2 to 3 was not effective. 2. In the case of single-column elution, L-lysine was not completely desorbed at any feed rate of ammonia into the system. Two-and three-column desorption systems showed similar results, with complete L-lysine desorption at feed rates of 6.6 X 10-2 mol/h and 1.0 X 10 (-1) mol/h of ammonia, respectively."

If not anticipated and planned for within a separation step, they can result in large equilibration volumes and potentially negative effects on pH-sensitive proteins. On the other hand, such pH variations, if controlled and directed, can be beneficial to the separation of proteins. The behavior of chromatographic columns packed with resins containing both weak cation exchange and weak anion exchange groups is investigated in order to obtain protein separations by means of internally generated pH gradients in response to step changes in buffer composition. A local equilibrium model is developed to predict pH transitions using non-adsorbed buffers, ie containing neutral or anionic buffering species with cation exchangers and neutral or cationic buffering species with anion exchangers. In agreement with experimental results, the model, based exclusively on the resins' titration curves, predicts practical, fairly linear gradients, which are formed using suitable mixtures of acidic buffers for cation exchange and basic buffers for anion exchange. The separation of mixtures of ovalbumin, albumin, and transferrin is used as a model system with cation exchange columns while the separations of transferrin and of mAb charge variants are used as model systems with anion exchange columns. The peaks obtained with this approach are much sharper than could be obtained isocratically or using externally generated, unretained gradients as a \u2026"

                "abstract": "In this work we analyze the effects of the weak acid content of macroporous cation exchange resins based on acrylamido and vinyl polymers that contain different amounts of weak acid groups in addition to their main sulphopropyl cation exchange functionality. UNOsphere S and Rapid S resins from Bio-Rad Laboratories are used for this comparison. When operated at pH values below 7, the presence of weak acid groups in UNOsphere S results in substantial pH transients, which are induced by changes in salt concentration, even though the mobile phase is buffered. These transients are greatly reduced with UNOsphere Rapid S, which contains a much lower concentration of weak acid groups, permitting very rapid requilibration and avoiding any significant change in pH during protein elution with salt. Protein adsorption equilibrium and mass transfer rates were also studied for both materials using several proteins with molecular masses between 15 and 150 kDa. Despite its much lower concentration of weak acid groups, UNOsphere Rapid S exhibits protein adsorption capacities and effective pore diffusivities that are essentially the same as those observed for UNOsphere S. These results suggest that the weak acid groups in UNOsphere S are primarily associated with the polymer backbone structure and do not interact directly with proteins molecules."

                "abstract": "We have recently developed a new method to image transient patterns of protein adsorption in individual spherical chromatographic particles under strong binding conditions. The method takes advantage of the difference in refractive index between the protein-free and protein-saturated adsorbent matrix. When the particles are viewed with an ordinary microscope using white light illumination, the adsorption front appears as a bright ring that moves in time from the surface of the particle to its center. Experimental data were previously obtained for a limited number of proteins with the cation exchanger SP-Sepharose-FF. Sharp rings were observed confirming that protein mass transfer within the particles occurs via a shell-progressive diffusion mechanism. Quantitative analysis based on the shrinking core model provided an accurate and precise way of determining the intraparticle diffusivity for individual particles. In this work we extend these measurements to investigate (a) the effect of ionic strength on protein adsorption in IEX resins,(b) the adsorption of different proteins in agarose-based HIC resins, and (c) the adsorption of IgG in Protein A adsorbents."

These isoforms are best understood by evaluating their biological activity using bioassays that measure their biochemical or biological function. Availability of preparative amounts of these variants is essential for these assays. Many of the analytical techniques that are capable of separating these isoforms either do not provide material that can used readily or are not amenable to fractionation or scale-up.In this study we report successful separation and/or enrichment of protein isoforms that arise due to differences in aggregation and sialation using preparative, high resolution pH based separation methods. Shallow gradients of over 20 column volumes over one pH unit provide a high resolution power, even under relatively high loads (2-5 mg/ml resin). Representative data from a couple of representative protein molecules that have been successfully separated using these techniques is presented."

Macroscopic measurements of mass transfer rates can provide quantitative information about transport behavior. However, such measurements are subject to multiple mechanistic interpretations since different models often result in qualitatively similar macroscopic behavior. On the other hand, the measurement of concentration profiles within stationary phases at the microscopic level is thought to provide greater insight in the nature of the transport mechanism. In the past, such measurements have been conducted for charged polyacrylamide gels supported within thin capillaries and for spherical ion exchange particles by confocal microscopy using fluorescently labeled proteins. In this work, we extend the visualization of concentration profiles to charged agarose gels supported in microfluidics chips using optical microscopy with chromatophoric proteins. In order to directly view concentration profiles during transient adsorption and desorption, thin (100 um) slabs of anionic agarose gels are synthesized on etched glass microfluidics chips. A protein solution flows past the exposed edge of the gel slab and a microscope with CCD camera is used to monitor the evolution of concentration profiles in the slab. The latter is converted to protein concentration using a calibration curve. We have studied the behavior of three proteins, cytochrome c, myoglobin, and hemoglobin.

The concentration includes the three required courses: Introduction to Biotechnology, Biochemical Engineering, Bioseparation Engineering as well as two elective bioscience courses. The bioseparation engineering course covers specialized unit operations that are not normally covered in regular chemical engineering courses, including sedimentation and centrifugation, membrane-based separations, adsorption and chromatography, precipitation, and crystallization. After a brief summary of the molecular properties of typical biomolecules, these operations are introduced in the order they typically would be conducted downstream of the initial manufacture of biotechnology products. Ancillary operations such as sterile processing, clean-in-place and regulatory aspects are briefly covered. In order to provide a practical exposure to bioseparations, the course also includes an experimental component where students, divided in teams, conduct and analyze experiments in membrane ultrafiltration and chromatography. The experiments are conducted focusing on engineering measurements of physical parameters needed for scale-up and design of processing units, much as they would be conducted in an industrial process development setting.

Considerable advances in our understanding of protein adsorption kinetics have been made in recent years by means of microscopy techniques, which allow a visualization of protein concentration profiles in the adsorbent using either colored or fuorescently labeled proteins. However, a complementary technique is based on the use of radioactive tracers. With such tracers measurements can be conducted with optically opaque particles and mass transfer rates can be determined directly. Moreover mass transfer kinetics can be determined readily under both gradient and tracer diffusion conditions. In this work we have used I125 labeled lysozyme and?-chymotrypsinogen to determine the adsorption kinetics in three different cation exchangers: SP-Sepharose-FF, SP-Sepharose-XL, and S-HyperD. The radiolabeled proteins were found to be stable and indistinguishable from the unlabeled proteins in high-resolution gradient elution cation exchange chromatography. Measurements of adsorption kinetics were conducted with a shallow-bed placed directly in the lead-shielded chamber of a radioactivity detector. With this arrangement protein uptake and desorption curves are obtained directly at a constant protein concentration by following the bed radioactivity as a function of time. Very different mass transfer rates were obtained for the three different adsorbents considered in this work. Moreover there was a profound difference in the \u2026"

Previous work has demonstrated the utility of this technology for the separation of various materials by isocratic elution on a bench scale. Novel applications and improved operation of the process were studied in this work, demonstrating that CAC is a versatile apparatus which is capable of separations at high throughput. Three specific separation systems were investigated. Pilot-scale separations at high loadings were performed using an industrial sugar mixture as an example of scale-up for isocratic separations. Bench-scale experiments of a low concentration metal ion mixture were performed to demonstrate stepwise elution, a chromatographic technique which decreases dilution and increases sorbent capacity. Finally, the separation of mixtures of amino acids by ion exchange was investigated to demonstrate the use of displacement development on the CAC. This technique, which perhaps has the most potential, when applied to the CAC allowed simultaneous separation and concentration of multicomponent mixtures on a continuous basis. Mathematical models were developed to describe the CAC performance and optimize the operating conditions. For all the systems investigated, the continuous separation performance of the CAC was found to be very nearly the same as the batchwise performance of conventional chromatography. The technology appears, thus, to be very promising for industrial applications."

Advances in bioprocessing systems will provide important alternatives for the future utilization of various energy resources and for the control of environmental hazards that can result from energy generation. Although research in the fundamental biological sciences has helped set the scene for a ''new biotechnology,'' the major impediment to rapid commercialization for energy applications is the lack of a firm understanding of the necessary engineering concepts. Engineering research is now the essential ''bridge'' that will allow the development of a wide range of energy-related bioprocessing systems. A workshop entitled ''Bioprocessing Research for Energy Applications'' was held to address this technological area, to define the engineering research needs, and to identify those opportunities which would encourage rapid implementation of advanced bioprocessing concepts."

Aldehydes react with bisulfite to form hydroxyalkanesulfonates (HASA), which are the conjugate bases of strong acids. Aldehydes are shown to be transported efficiently across an anion-exchange membrane via the coupled countertransport of HMSA ion with hydroxide ion and the relay of an aldehyde from one membrane-bound bisulfite ion to another. Permeation rates are in the order of formaldehyde> acetaldehyde> acetone; this relationship parallels the relative order of the stability constants for formation of the respective adducts with bisulfite ion. Aldehydes can be separated readily from other organic solutes by this method.The selective transport of organic solutes plays a very important role in biological membranes (Kotyk et al., 1988). However, in synthetic membranes, the controlled transport of organic solutes is very difficult to achieve. The selective transport system for aldehydes, which is described in this paper, may be useful as a commercial separation process. Similar systems can be developed to separate other organic solutes."

These investigations include experimental measurements of ion-exchange uptake equilibria in binary and multicomponent systems and their correlation and interpretation in terms of a recently developed equilibrium theory; measurements and interpretation of uptake rates aimed at the refinement of mass transfer models and to their validation in terms of independent microscopic measurements; investigations of the dynamic behavior of ion-exchange resin beds for production scale chromatographic separations of amino acids; and development of efficient algorithms for the numerical solution of partial differential equation models for these systems. The results of these fundamental studies are of immediate practical value, as they are directly related to industrially important systems for which there is considerable need for process improvements. A few applications of this work have been considered, including separation of amino acid mixture by continuous annular chromatography."

In this work we examine the underlying mechanisms and the conditions that affect aggregate formation.Incubating the multimodal anion exchangers with pure BSA monomer at low ionic strength results in the formation of dimer and higher order oligomers (up to hexamers) to an extent that depends on the incubation time. The percentage of total protein initially bound that is desorbed decreased from >85% with a 5\u2009min incubation to <40 \u2026"

We analyse the eigenfrequencies of finite, strongly damaged, elongated solids with reference to the propagation bands of an infinite strip with a periodic damage. Subsequently, we determine analytically the band-gaps of the infinite strip by using a lower-dimensional model, represented by a periodically damaged beam in which the small ligaments between cracks are modelled as \u2018elastic junctions\u2019. The effective rotational and translational stiffnesses of the elastic junctions are obtained from an ad hoc asymptotic analysis. We show that, for a finite frequency range, the dispersion curves for the reduced beam model agree with the dispersion data determined numerically for the two-dimensional elastic strip. Exponential localization, boundary layers and standing waves in strongly damaged systems are discussed in detail."

Animal studies have extended these observations, providing insight into a broad range of underlying molecular and physiological events. Brain mapping studies in human patients have provided observations at the systems level that often parallel findings in animals. In general, the best outcomes are associated with the greatest return toward the normal state of brain functional organization.

The goal of this study was to determine whether a hand-wrist robot would improve motor function, and to evaluate the specificity of therapy effects on brain reorganization. Subjects with chronic stroke producing moderate right arm/hand weakness received 3 weeks therapy that emphasized intense active movement repetition as well as attention, speed, force, precision and timing, and included virtual reality games. Subjects initiated hand movements. If necessary, the robot completed movements, a feature available at all visits for seven of the subjects and at the latter half of visits for six of the subjects.

Such an approach to ARAT scoring would likely reduce variance between investigators and sites.

By using robots to apply novel force fields to the arm, investigators are gaining insight into how the nervous system models its external dynamic environment. The nervous system builds internal models gradually by experience and uses them in combination with impedance and feedback control strategies. Internal models are robust to environmental and neural noise, generalized across space, implemented in multiple brain regions, and developed in childhood. Robots are also being used to assist in repetitive movement practice following neurologic injury, providing insight into movement recovery. Robots can haptically assess sensorimotor performance, administer training, quantify amount of training, and improve motor recovery. In addition to providing insight into motor control, robotic paradigms may eventually enhance motor learning and rehabilitation beyond the levels possible with conventional training techniques."

However, the neural mechanisms supporting rehabilitation-induced motor recovery are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to assess motor cortical reorganization after CIMT using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a repeated-measures design, 4 incompletely recovered chronic stroke patients treated with CIMT underwent motor function testing and fMRI. Five age-matched normal subjects were also imaged. A laterality index (LI) was determined from the fMRI data, reflecting the distribution of activation in motor cortices contralateral compared with ipsilateral to the moving hand. Pre-intervention fMRI showed a lower LI during affected hand movement of stroke patients (LI = 0.23 \u00b1 0.07) compared to controls (LI \u2026"

Many clinical characteristics of stroke recovery resemble normal development, particularly in the motor system. Consistent with this, brain-mapping studies after an ischemic insult suggest re-emergence of childhood organizational patterns: recovery being associated with a return to adult patterns. Experimental animal studies demonstrate increased levels of developmental proteins, particularly in the area surrounding an infarct, suggesting an active process of reconditioning in response to cerebral ischemia. Understanding the patterns of similarity between normal development and stroke recovery might be of value in its treatment."

Stage of development across therapies varies widely, from preclinical to late\u2010phase clinical trials.

Activation of distinct motor cortex regions during ipsilateral and contralateral finger movements. J. Neurophysiol. 81: 383\u2013387, 1999. Previous studies have shown that unilateral finger movements are normally accompanied by a small activation in ipsilateral motor cortex. The magnitude of this activation has been shown to be altered in a number of conditions, particularly in association with stroke recovery. The site of this activation, however, has received limited attention. To address this question, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study precentral gyrus activation in six control and three stroke patients during right index finger tapping, then during left index finger tapping. In each hemisphere, the most significantly activated site (P < 0.001 required) was identified during ipsilateral and during \u2026"

With >1 billion overweight and 300 million obese persons worldwide, it is crucial to understand the implications of carrying this very common allele for the health of our aging population. FTO is highly expressed in the brain and elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with brain atrophy, but it is unknown how the obesity-associated risk allele affects human brain structure. We therefore generated 3D maps of regional brain volume differences in 206 healthy elderly subjects scanned with MRI and genotyped as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found a pattern of systematic brain volume deficits in carriers of the obesity-associated risk allele versus \u2026"

A single nucleotide polymorphism for this growth factor, val66met, is common and associated with decreased activity-dependent BDNF release. The current study evaluated the effects of this polymorphism in relation to human brain motor system function, short-term plasticity, and learning. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning during right index finger movement (n\u2009=\u200924) identified activation in a broad sensorimotor network. However, subjects with the polymorphism showed smaller activation volume within several brain regions as compared with subjects without the polymorphism. Repeat fMRI after 25 min of right index finger training found that the 2 genotype groups modulated brain activation differently. In several brain regions, subjects with the polymorphism showed greater activation \u2026"

The device is based on the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton (WREX), a passive, mobile arm support developed for children with arm weakness caused by a debilitative condition. Previously, we scaled WREX for use by adults, instrumented it with potentiometers, and incorporated a simple grip strength sensor. The resulting passive device (Training WREX or \"T-WREX\") allows individuals with severe motor impairment to practice functional movements (reaching, eating, and washing) in a simple virtual reality environment called Java Therapy 2.0. However, the device is limited since it can only apply a fixed pattern of assistive forces to the arm. In addition, its gravity balance function does not restore full range of motion. Therefore, we are also developing a robotic version of WREX named Pneu \u2026"

The 3 degrees-of-freedom device is pneumatically-actuated and backdriveable. The design of HWARD was guided by neurobiological principles of motor learning, such as sensorimotor integration, movement repetition, environmental complexity, and attention. Specifically, HWARD can assist repetitive grasping and releasing movements while allowing the subject to feel real objects during therapy. The use of real objects having rich sensory and functional characteristics can stimulate sensorimotor cortex activation while enhancing subject motivation and attention - features hypothesized to reduce impairment and disability. A pilot study tests the safety and efficacy of HWARD, with endpoints that include \u2026"

In this paper, we leveraged the technology of free-hand interaction to rehabilitate patients with stroke. We modified the game of Fruit Ninja to use Leap Motion controller's hand tracking data for stroke patients with arm and hand weakness to practice their finger individuation. In a pilot study, we recruited 14 patients with chronic stroke to play the game using natural interaction. Their Fruit Ninja (FN) scores show high correlation with the standard clinical assessment scores such as Fugl-Meyer (FMA) and Box-and-Blocks Test (BBT) scores. This finding suggests that our free-hand Fruit Ninja's score is a good indicator of the patient's hand function and therefore will be informative if used in their rehabilitation."

In humans, this relationship has received little study during a power grip such as squeezing, and has previously only been evaluated across a narrow range of forces. Functional MRI was performed in eight healthy subjects who alternated between rest and right hand squeezing at one of three force levels. During scanning, motor performances were recorded using a dynamometer. At each force level, activation volume was measured within left sensorimotor cortex, right sensorimotor cortex, and a midline supplementary motor area. In left sensorimotor cortex, % signal change was also assessed. The range of force generated across the three force levels varied from 4.9 N to 276 N. In left sensorimotor cortex, activation volume increased significantly with greater force. The % signal change also \u2026"

We measured MM in stroke and control subjects and evaluated whether MM after stroke are related to motor function.Methods\u2014Twenty-three patients and 16 control subjects were studied. A computerized dynamometer was used during two squeezing tasks to measure intended movements from the active hand as well as MM from the opposite hand. Motor deficits were measured with the arm motor component of the Fugl-Meyer scale.Results\u2014During paretic hand squeezing, MM in the unaffected hand were detected in 70% (repetitive squeeze) to 78% (sustained squeeze) of stroke patients. For both tasks, this was significantly (P<0.05) greater than the incidence of MM in the paretic hand or in either hand of control subjects (17% to 44 \u2026"

Performance of this approach was evaluated for the upper extremity portion. Results. Inter- and intrarater reliability in 31 patients were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.98-0.99), validity was excellent (r = 0.74-0.93, P < .0001), and minimal detectable change was low (3.2 points).

In this study, we examined whether haptic guidance-as-needed can improve long-term retention (across 1 week) of the steering task, with age and initial skill level as independent variables. Training with guidance-as-needed allowed all participants to learn to steer without experiencing large errors. For young participants (age 18\u201330), training with guidance-as-needed produced better long-term retention of driving skill than did training without guidance. For older participants (age 65\u201392), training with guidance-as-needed improved long-term retention in tracking error, but not significantly. However, for a subset of less skilled, older subjects \u2026"

Mesenchymal stromal cells may aid in reducing the long-term impact of stroke via multiple mechanisms that include induction of angiogenesis, promotion of neurogenesis, prevention of apoptosis, and immunomodulation. In this review, we discuss the clinical rationale of MSC for stroke therapy in the context of their emerging utility in other diseases, and their recent clinical approval for treatment of graft-versus-host disease.

A major question is how to balance these competing goals and assure the broadest range of approved usage. One key consideration is to structure entry criteria with respect to properties of the cell therapy of interest, for example, patients with renal dysfunction or a history of neoplasia might be excluded when this is a particular concern for the therapy being evaluated. We favor identifying adverse interactions in preclinical studies, which echoes recommendations for the development of acute stroke therapies. 10 Another key issue is to select patients with respect to the natural history of the stroke syndrome because the null hypothesis in a cell therapy trial is that there is no difference compared with natural recovery. Most patients exhibit a limited spontaneous recovery \u2026"

Healthy subjects (n = 20) attempted to reproduce a novel three-dimensional path after practicing it with mechanical guidance from a robot. Subjects viewed their arm as the robot guided it, so this \"haptic guidance\" training condition provided both somatosensory and visual input.

Among the more frequent long-term complications following stroke are spasticity-related disabilities. Although spasticity alone occurs in up to 60% of stroke survivors, disabling spasticity affects only 4\u201310%. Spasticity further interferes with important functions of daily life when it occurs in association with pain, motor impairment, and overall declines of cognitive and neurological function. It is proposed that the aftermath of stroke be considered a chronic disease requiring a multifactorial and multilevel approach. There are, however, knowledge gaps related to the prediction and recognition of poststroke disability. Interventions to prevent or minimise such \u2026"

In both patients, affected white matter showed hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images associated with a decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. In one patient studied serially, ADC values normalized by 3 weeks after tetraplegia. Early in the clinical course, diagnosis of CPM can sometimes be difficult. Hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images may therefore have diagnostic utility. Decreased lesional ADC values support the notion that CPM is a consequence of relative intracellular hypotonicity."

To test the ability of the new device (Training-WREX or \"T-WREX\") to measure and assist in functional arm movements, we measured five chronic stroke subjects' movement ability while wearing the orthosis without gravity balance compared to wearing the orthosis with gravity balance.

Several studies suggest that greater injury is associated with reduced laterality of brain activity. This might be in relation to changes in interhemispheric inhibition and is a phenomenon that is likely useful for functional gains in some patients. Many other features of brain activity change in the months after a stroke, including the site and size of activation in relevant brain network nodes.

Just as familiar languages have been shown to use distinct brain processes, we hypothesized that an analogous difference might be found in music and that it may depend in part on subjects' formal musical knowledge. Using fMRI we compared the activation patterns of professional musicians and untrained controls reared in the United States as they listened to music from their culture (Western) and from an unfamiliar culture (Chinese).

A telerehabilitation-based program may overcome these barriers. We designed, then evaluated a home-based telerehabilitation system in patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Methods. Patients were 3 to 24 months poststroke with stable arm motor deficits. Each received 28 days of telerehabilitation using a system delivered to their home. Each day consisted of 1 structured hour focused on individualized exercises and games, stroke education, and an hour of free play. Results. Enrollees (n = 12) had baseline Fugl-Meyer (FM) scores of 39 \u00b1 12 (mean \u00b1 SD). Compliance was excellent: participants engaged in therapy on 329/336 (97.9%) assigned days.

Although frontal-temporal gray matter abnormalities have been consistently demonstrated in TLE, white matter connections between these two lobes require further study in this disease setting. We therefore investigated the integrity of two major frontal-temporal white matter association tracts, uncinate fasciculus (UF) and arcuate fasciculus (AF), and their clinical correlates.Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography, integrity of the UF and AF was examined in 22 individuals (12 subjects with TLE and 10 age-matched healthy controls). DTI indices of these tracts were compared between the two subject groups and correlates examined with clinical variables that included age of seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, history of febrile seizure and antiepileptic medication exposure.In \u2026"

The objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate the impact of training with BONES on function of the affected upper limb, and to assess whether multijoint functional robotic training would translate into greater gains in arm function than single joint robotic training also conducted with BONES. Twenty subjects with mild to moderate chronic stroke participated in this crossover study. Each subject experienced multijoint functional training and single joint training three sessions per week, for four weeks, with the order of presentation randomized.

One major target for these advances is stroke, where most patients can be left with significant disability. Treatments have the potential to improve the victim's quality of life significantly and reduce the time and expense of rehabilitation. Brain Repair After Stroke reviews the biology of spontaneous brain repair after stroke in animal models and in humans. Detailed chapters cover the many forms of therapy being explored to promote brain repair and consider clinical trial issues in this context. This book provides a summary of the neurobiology of innate and treatment-induced repair mechanisms after hypoxia and reviews the state of the art for human therapeutics in relation to promoting behavioral recovery after stroke. Essential reading for stroke physicians, neurologists, rehabilitation physicians and neuropsychologists."

Recent preclinical and clinical studies highlight the opportunity to administer treatments in the subacute and chronic phase of stroke to promote neurological recovery. Because different neurological deficits recover to different extents at different rates after stroke, putative stroke recovery-promoting treatments may exert differential effects on various functional aspects of stroke recovery. For this reason, we propose that the use of modality-specific outcome measures may be best suited as primary end points in clinical trials of stroke recovery-promoting agents. The use of such end points may result in a more selective labeling of stroke recovery treatments."

Associations with mitochondrial genotype were also explored.Methods:\u2002 Genotypes were determined in 255 stroke patients who also received behavioral evaluations in the Glycine Antagonist In Neuroprotection (GAIN) clinical trials. The primary outcome measure was recovery during the first month post\u2010stroke, as this is the time when neural repair is at a maximum and so when genetic influences might have their largest impact.

It may occur as a primary disease or as a syndrome in association with a variety of conditions, and its pathogenesis remains unexplained. There are relatively few reports describing the occurrence of moyamoya in Down syndrome.

In this protocol we describe a method for systematically assessing training-induced changes in corticospinal output that integrates volumetric anatomical MRI with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A TMS coil is sited to a target grid superimposed onto a 3D MRI of cortex using a stereotaxic neuronavigation system. Subjects are then required to exercise the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle on two different tasks for a total of 30 min. The protocol allows for reliably and repeatedly detecting changes in corticospinal output to FDI muscle in response to brief periods of motor training."

In addition, we reviewed all autopsy cases since 1972 and available lumbar puncture data on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital. Invasion of the CNS by chronic lymphocytic leukemia often leads to confusional state, meningitis with cranial nerve abnormalities, optic neuropathy, or cerebellar dysfunction. Lumbar puncture shows a lymphocytosis consisting of monoclonal B cells, but CSF cytology studies are of limited value in establishing the diagnosis.

In the context of this workshop, translation refers to the research necessary to move a promising therapeutic along the drug development pipeline.

Exploratory approaches may focus on disease mechanisms and use simpler rodent models to gain rigorous information on a putative therapeutic target. However, later-stage confirmatory studies of putative therapies would benefit from the same design features adopted in clinical trials, including heterogeneous populations, adequate sample size, end points predictive of clinical outcomes, and routes of administration similar to therapeutic use, as well as reporting of study results, including \u2026"

Dopaminergic drugs are the focus of many therapies targeting the motor system, where high inter-individual differences in response are common. The current study examined the hypothesis that genetic variation in the dopamine system is associated with significant differences in motor learning, brain plasticity, and the effects of the dopamine precursor L-Dopa. Skilled motor learning and motor cortex plasticity were assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 50 healthy adults during two study weeks, one with placebo and one with L-Dopa. The influence of five polymorphisms with established effects on dopamine neurotransmission was summed using a gene score, with higher scores corresponding to higher dopaminergic neurotransmission. Secondary hypotheses examined each polymorphism individually. While training on placebo, higher gene scores were associated with greater motor learning (p = .03). The effect of L-Dopa on learning varied with the gene score (gene score*drug interaction, p = .008): participants with lower gene scores, and thus lower endogenous dopaminergic neurotransmission, showed the largest learning improvement with L-Dopa relative to placebo (p<.0001), while L-Dopa had a detrimental effect in participants with higher gene scores (p = .01). Motor cortex plasticity, assessed via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), also showed a gene score*drug interaction (p = .02). Individually, DRD2/ANKK1 genotype was significantly associated with motor learning (p = .02) and its modulation by L-Dopa (p<.0001), but not with any \u2026"

Recent advances in EEG hardware, recording electrodes, and EEG software could overcome these limitations. The present study examined how well dense-array (256 electrodes) EEG, acquired with a saline-lead net and analyzed with whole brain partial least squares (PLS) modeling, captured extent of acute stroke behavioral deficits and varied in relation to acute brain injury. In 24 patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke, 3 min of resting-state EEG was acquired at bedside, including in the ER and ICU. Traditional quantitative EEG measures (power in a specific lead, in any frequency band) showed a modest association with behavioral deficits [NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score] in bivariate models. However, PLS models of delta or beta power \u2026"

Drugs that enhance recovery are separate from those that promote neuroprotection or reperfusion in patients with stroke. Recovery-based drugs have distinct therapeutic targets that are related to plasticity and growth after stroke, and in general, improvements in behavioral outcome are not accompanied by a reduction in infarct volume. Interventions targeting recovery have a time window measured in days or sometimes weeks-months, suggesting potential utility for a large percentage of patients with stroke. Currently, among drugs that enhance motor recovery after stroke in humans, the strongest evidence exists for serotonergic and dopaminergic agents. Restorative therapies generally target the brain directly, in contrast to approved stroke therapeutics that target arteries, clots \u2026"

Although abnormalities of monoamine neurotransmission, including dopamine, are theorized to contribute to the pathophysiology of depression, evidence linking dopamine-related genes to depression has been mixed. The current study sought to address this knowledge-gap by examining whether the combined effect of dopamine polymorphisms was associated with depressive symptomatology in both healthy individuals and individuals with depression.  Methods Data were drawn from three independent samples: (1) a discovery sample of healthy adult participants (n = 273); (2) a replication sample of adults with depression (n = 1,267); and (3) a replication sample of healthy adult participants (n = 382). A genetic risk score was created by combining functional polymorphisms from five genes involved in synaptic dopamine availability (COMT and DAT) and dopamine receptor binding (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3).  Results In the discovery sample, the genetic risk score was associated with depressive symptomatology (\u03b2 = \u22120.80, p = 0.003), with lower dopamine genetic risk scores (indicating lower dopaminergic neurotransmission) predicting higher levels of depression. This result was replicated with a similar genetic risk score based on imputed genetic data from adults with depression (\u03b2 = \u22120.51, p = 0.04). Results were of similar magnitude and in the expected direction in a cohort of healthy adult participants (\u03b2 = \u22120.86, p = 0.15).

Jhanas are Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) that imply major brain changes based on subjective reports: (1) external awareness dims, (2) internal verbalizations fade, (3) the sense of personal boundaries is altered, (4) attention is highly focused on the object of meditation, and (5) joy increases to high levels. The fMRI and EEG results from an experienced meditator show changes in brain activity in 11 regions shown to be associated with the subjective reports, and these changes occur promptly after jhana is entered. In particular, the extreme joy is associated not only with activation of cortical processes but also with activation of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the dopamine/opioid reward system. We test three mechanisms by which the subject might stimulate his own reward system by external means and reject all three. Taken together, these results demonstrate an apparently novel method of self-stimulating a brain reward system using only internal mental processes in a highly trained subject."

Structural and diffusion tensor MR scans, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) targeting cognitive flexibility, and the Trail Making Test B examining parallel sequencing were obtained from 9 patients with left TLE and 17 healthy controls. The five major findings were: (1) Caudate volume is reduced on the left side in TLE. (2) The atrophy involves the dorsal and ventral head of the caudate. (3) These atrophic caudate regions have a corresponding high probability of connections to dorsal prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex. (4) Smaller caudate volumes are linked to greater numbers of WCST perseverative errors. (5) Reduced connections between caudate and dorsal prefrontal cortex correlated with poorer scores on the Trail Making Test B. The \u2026"

The major specific afflictions that affect patients with stroke who experience pain include central poststroke pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and pain associated with spasticity and shoulder subluxation. Each disorder carries its own intricacies that require specific approaches to treatment and understanding. This review aims to present and clarify the major pain syndromes that affect patients who have experienced a stroke in order to aid in their diagnosis and treatment."

Drug dose (0.25 to 4 mg once daily) was titrated weekly, as tolerated. The primary end point was gait velocity during the 12 weeks of study participation.Results\u2014 Patients in the ropinirole+PT group averaged 2.4 mg/d by end of week 9, although the target dose was at least 3 mg/d.

Patients were studied serially after stroke (mean t1, = 16 days after stroke, t2 = 3.5 months later) using perfusion-weighted imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging during finger movement. Controls (n = 7) showed no significant change in regional activation volumes over time. Among stroke patients (n = 8), however, recovery was accompanied by several patterns of functional magnetic resonance imaging change, with increased activation volumes over time in five patients and decreased in two. Most regions increasing activation over time were in the stroke hemisphere. Of the five patients showing increased activation over time, specific activation foci enlarged at t2 were already activated at t1 in four patients, and at least one focus growing from t1 to t2 \u2026"

The robot allows naturalistic motion of the arm and is as mechanically compliant as a human therapist's arms. This compliance preserves the connection between effort and error that appears essential for motor learning, but presents a challenge: accurately creating desired movements requires that the robot form a model of the patient's weakness, since the robot cannot simply stiffly drive the arm along the desired path. We show here that a standard model-based adaptive controller allows the robot to form such a model of the patient and complete movements accurately. However, we found that the human motor system, when coupled to such an adaptive controller, reduces its own participation, allowing the adaptive controller to take over the performance of the task.

Twenty-four subjects completed a 12-day protocol of daily training on a marble navigation task that required intense use of the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle. In parallel, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) mapping was used to assess serial measures of short-term cortical motor map plasticity, plus long-term cortical motor map plasticity, of the cortical FDI map. On Day 1, subjects with the polymorphism did not show significant short-term cortical motor map plasticity over 30 min of FDI activity, but subjects without the polymorphism did.

In this paper, AR is combined with haptics in order to observe human arm's stiffness. A haptic, hand-held device is used to measure the human arm's impedance. While a computer vision system tracks and records the position of the hand, a computer screen displays the impedance diagrams superimposed on the hand in a real-time video feed. The visual augmentation is also performed using a video projector that project's the diagrams on the hand as it moves."

A number of factors influence neural plasticity and recovery of function after brain injury. The current review considers the impact of genetic factors. Polymorphisms in the human genes coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and apolipoprotein E have been studied in the context of plasticity and stroke recovery and are discussed here in detail. Several processes involved in plasticity and stroke recovery, such as depression or pharmacotherapy effects, are modulated by other genetic polymorphisms and are also discussed. Finally, new genetic polymorphisms that have not been studied in the context of stroke are proposed as new directions for study. A better understanding of genetic influences on \u2026"

The primary endpoint was the composite neurological score, measured 11 times, from 1 h until 12 weeks post-insult. The neurological score was different across treatment groups (p < 0.03).

Hence, new neuro-rehabilitative therapies are being sought to generate permanent improvements in motor function beyond those of conventional physiotherapies through positive neural plasticity processes. Here, the authors describe an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) system that enabled a stroke subject with foot drop to re-establish foot dorsiflexion. To this end, a prediction model was generated from EEG data collected as the subject alternated between periods of idling and attempted foot dorsiflexion.

Hand motor function was localized at a fourth center guiding intervention for those randomized to stimulation.Results\u2014 The fMRI results were available within 24 hours. Across 12 patients, activation site variability was substantial (12, 23, and 11 mm in x, y, and z directions), exceeding stimulating electrode dimensions.Conclusion\u2014 Use of fMRI to guide decision-making in a clinical stroke trial is feasible."

Most patients show improvement in the weeks-months following a stroke. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these behavioral gains may be useful for refining treatments that aim to improve outcome and reduce disability. A number of brain mapping studies have examined how stroke affects motor system function. Numerous changes have been identified in this setting and are reviewed herein, including reduced laterality, widespread changes across a distributed sensorimotor network, and a change in the site and size of key activation foci. Some of these changes have been found to correlate with features of injury, behavior, or treatment-induced behavioral gains. A current challenge is to extend these findings to improve clinical decision making."

                "abstract": "Many stroke survivors have significant long-term gait impairment, often involving foot drop. Current physiotherapies provide limited recovery. Orthoses substitute for ankle strength, but they provide no lasting therapeutic effect. Brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a novel rehabilitative approach that may generate permanent neurological improvements. This study explores the safety and feasibility of a foot-drop-targeted BCI-FES physiotherapy in chronic stroke survivors. Subjects (n\u2009=\u20099) operated an electroencephalogram-based BCI-FES system for foot dorsiflexion in 12 one-hour sessions over four weeks. Gait speed, dorsiflexion active range of motion (AROM), six-minute walk distance (6MWD), and Fugl-Meyer leg motor (FM-LM) scores were assessed before, during, and after therapy. The primary safety outcome measure was the proportion of subjects that deteriorated in gait speed by \u22650.16 m/s at one week or four weeks post-therapy. The secondary outcome measures were the proportion of subjects that experienced a clinically relevant decrease in dorsiflexion AROM (\u22652.5\u00b0), 6MWD (\u226520 %), and FM-LM score (\u226510 %) at either post-therapy assessment. No subjects (0/9) experienced a clinically significant deterioration in gait speed, dorsiflexion AROM, 6MWT distance, or FM-LM score at either post-therapy assessment. Five subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (\u22650.06 m/s) in gait speed, three subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (\u22652.5\u00b0) in dorsiflexion AROM, five subjects demonstrated a detectable increase (\u226510 %) in 6MWD, and three subjects demonstrated a detectable \u2026"

Injury measures calculated from baseline magnetic resonance imaging included (1) percent CST overlap with stroke, (2) CST-related atrophy (cerebral peduncle area), (3) CST integrity (fractional anisotropy) in the cerebral peduncle, and (4) CST integrity in the posterior limb of internal capsule.Percent CST overlap with stroke, CST-related \u2026"

                "abstract": "Vector auto-regressive (VAR) models typically form the basis for constructing directed graphical models for investigating connectivity in a brain network with brain regions of interest (ROIs) as nodes. There are limitations in the standard VAR models. The number of parameters in the VAR model increases quadratically with the number of ROIs and linearly with the order of the model and thus due to the large number of parameters, the model could pose serious estimation problems. Moreover, when applied to imaging data, the standard VAR model does not account for variability in the connectivity structure across all subjects. In this paper, we develop a novel generalization of the VAR model that overcomes these limitations. To deal with the high dimensionality of the parameter space, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical framework for the VAR model that will account for both temporal correlation within a subject and between subject variation. Our approach uses prior distributions that give rise to estimates that correspond to penalized least squares criterion with the elastic net penalty. We apply the proposed model to investigate differences in effective connectivity during a hand grasp experiment between healthy controls and patients with residual motor deficit following a stroke."

Functional MRI was performed in 10 healthy right-footed participants during imagined, executed, and observed right ankle movements. Task compliance was high, confirmed via behavioral assessment and electromyographic measurements. Each task was also associated with its own profile of regional activation, however, overall, regional activation showed substantial overlap across the three lower extremity motor tasks. The findings suggest the utility of continued efforts to develop motor imagery and observation programs for improving lower extremity function in a range of clinical settings."

The apparatus include a transducer, adapted to generate an analog signal corresponding to frequency and/or force of the subject's motor event, eg, a repetitive motion; an amplifier, which amplifies the analog signal; an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, which converts the analog signal into a digital signal; and a computer. The computer is programmed to receive the digital signal as input, store the digital signal for subsequent retrieval, retrieve the stored digital signal for processing, and process the stored digital signal. The processing includes the measurement of mean force amongst the set of individual motor events over time and measurement of the mean frequency of the set of individual motor events over time."

Fifty-five individuals with chronic stroke (Fugl-Meyer motor score range 14 to 61) and 18 healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging and a set of motor behavior tests. Mean FA from the motor and sensory regions of the CC and from corticospinal tract (CST) were extracted and relationships with behavioral measures evaluated. Across all participants, FA in both CC regions was significantly decreased after stroke (p < 0.001) and showed a significant, positive correlation with level of motor function.

Sixteen older adults made a joystick movement under two conditions during functional magnetic resonance imaging.

We sought to explore the cerebral and cerebellar activation pattern elicited by finger tapping in an adolescent with Joubert syndrome and in a normal control subject using functional MRI. In contrast to the typical highly lateralized activation seen in our control subject, the subject with Joubert syndrome demonstrated striking bilateral activation of the sensorimotor and cerebellar cortex. Although our functional MRI data do not indicate a clear absence of decussation, the abnormal activation pattern observed suggests altered brain functional organization in relation to anatomic differences. Malformation of the hindbrain could result in recruitment of alternative pathways, similar to what has been observed following ischemic injury to the developing or mature central nervous system."

Baseline data were also collected from 14 young subjects. At baseline, elderly subjects had poorer motor performances, larger motor cortex maps, and smaller motor evoked potentials compared to young subjects. Degree of age-related differences in neurophysiology correlated inversely with motor performance, for example, larger map area correlated with weaker pinch grip force (r=\u22120.42, P=0.01).

There is a wide range in the degree of recovery from hemiparesis [2, 3]. Reorganization of brain function occurs over weeks to months following stroke and contributes to the final neurologic and functional condition of these patients. New therapies are emerging that can favorably modify brain reorganization after stroke and thereby improve patient outcomes. By understanding the physiology underlying brain reorganization after stroke optimal approaches to restorative treatment, both rehabilitative and pharmacologic, can be implemented.Many techniques have been used to study brain function in the setting of stroke recovery.

Understanding the factors that predict response to inpatient stroke rehabilitation may be useful, for example, to best individualize the content of therapy or maximize the efficiency with which resources are directed. This review evaluated the literature and found that numerous variables were associated with outcome after inpatient stroke rehabilitation. The strongest evidence exists for factors such as age, stroke subtype, nutritional status, and psychosocial factors such as living with family before the stroke or the presence of a caregiver. Functional status at admission, urinary incontinence, infection after stroke, and aphasia each can also affect prognosis. Strengths and weaknesses of cited studies were considered in an attempt to inform the design of future studies examining factors that predict response to inpatient rehabilitation \u2026"

However, wrist accelerometry does not measure joint movements of the hand, which are integral to functional use of the upper extremity. In this study, we used a custom-built, non-obtrusive device called the manumeter to measure both arm use (via wrist accelerometry) and hand use (via finger magnetometry) of a group of unimpaired subjects while they performed twelve motor tasks at three intensities. We also gave the devices to four stroke subjects and asked them to wear them for six hours a day for one month. From the in-lab testing we found that arm use was a strong predictor of hand use for individual tasks, but that the slope of the relationship varied by up to a factor of ~12 depending on the task being performed.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has high sensitivity for immediately detecting brain ischemia. This pilot study aimed to evaluate feasibility and utility of EEG for identifying patients with a large acute ischemic stroke during Emergency Department (ED) evaluation, as these data might be useful in the prehospital setting. Methods: A 3-minute resting EEG was recorded using a dense-array (256-lead) system in patients with suspected acute stroke arriving at the ED of a US Comprehensive Stroke Center. Results: An EEG was recorded in 24 subjects, 14 with acute cerebral ischemia (including 5 with large acute ischemic stroke) and 10 without acute cerebral ischemia. Median time from stroke onset to EEG was 6.6 hours; and from ED arrival to EEG, 1.9 hours. Delta band power (P = .004) and the \u2026"

Brain activation during right, as compared with left, foot movement was larger, with higher amplitude task-related motor cortex signal change, and higher laterality index. Brain activation during fast, as compared with slow, foot movement was larger in cortical and cerebellar areas but smaller in deep gray areas. Some principles of cerebral control of hand movement extend to foot, but exceptions found include that dominant foot movement showed greater activation than did nondominant, and faster foot movements activated bilateral deep gray matter structures less than did slower.

Orthopaedic intervention may be required to manage these disabilities. Nonsurgical management includes brachial plexus and phenol nerve blocks, which provide temporary relief of painful contractures and allow for a period of spontaneous neurologic recovery of up to 6 months. Definitive surgical procedures should be avoided during this time. After this period, surgical management can be valuable in releasing muscle spasticity, managing painful contractures, and positioning the deformed extremity in a more functional and aesthetically appealing position. Current surgical management is directed at reducing or eliminating muscle spasticity and joint contractures, with the goal of \u2026"

In this study we examined how well unimpaired subjects could learn to trace a novel path after they practiced it with mechanical guidance from a robot. The form of haptic guidance used was a virtual channel that constrained the hand to follow the desired path (a snake-like curve). Subjects substantially improved their ability to trace the path following practice with haptic guidance, relative to their performance following an initial visual demonstration. They slowly improved their performance with more haptic training. However, when asked to reproduce the path repeatedly, their performance degraded over the course of a few trials. The tracing errors were not random, but instead were consistent with a systematic \u2026"

In the AS condition, participants moved right or left based on an abstract, visual rule; in the execution only condition, participants moved in the same direction on every trial.

A study was conducted by the UCI Neurorehabilitation Lab to investigate the impact of stroke on motor-related brain regions. Functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected from stroke patients and healthy controls while the subjects performed a simple motor task. In addition to affecting local neuronal activation strength, stroke might also alter communications (i.e., connectivity) between brain regions. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach for the analysis of multi-subject fMRI data that allows us to explore brain changes due to stroke. Our approach simultaneously estimates activation and condition-specific connectivity at the group level, and provides estimates for region/subject-specific hemodynamic response functions. Moreover, our model uses spike-and-slab priors to allow for direct \u2026"

Therefore, novel modalities that may facilitate lasting neurological and functional improvements, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), have been explored. In this article, we assess the feasibility of BCI-controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) as a novel physiotherapy for post-stroke foot drop. Three chronic stroke survivors with foot drop received three, 1-hour sessions of therapy during 1 week. All subjects were able to purposefully operate the BCI-FES system in real time. Furthermore, the salient electroencephalographic (EEG) features used for classification by the data-driven methodology were determined to be physiologically relevant.

The identification of deep venous thromboses (DVTs) in this population would strengthen this hypothesis. The purpose of this study was to image the subdiaphragmatic venous system in a cohort of patients with cryptogenic strokes. Materials and Methods. In 37 patients with cryptogenic brain ischemia and interatrial communication, duplex studies of calf, popliteal, and femoral veins, and magnetic resonance imaging venograms of the pelvis veins were performed. Results. In 10 patients, DVTs were diagnosed that were considered to be the cause of cryptogenic brain ischemia on probable (n = 6) or possible (n = 4) bases. In these patients, the median time from stroke to DVT was 3.25 days. In 5 of these 10 patients, DVTs did not involve popliteal and femoral veins, areas \u2026"

We previously studied healthy subjects with EEG and identified a frontoparietal circuit in which activity predicted training-related gains in visuomotor tracking. Here we asked whether activity in this same frontoparietal circuit also predicts training-related gains in visuomotor tracking in patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Subjects (n=12) underwent dense-array EEG recording at rest, then received 8 sessions of visuomotor tracking training delivered via home-based telehealth methods. Subjects showed significant training-related gains in the primary behavioral endpoint, Success Rate score on a standardized test of visuomotor tracking, increasing an average of 24.2\u00b121.9% (p=0.003). Activity in the circuit of interest, measured as coherence (20-30Hz) between leads overlying ipsilesional frontal (motor cortex) and parietal lobe, significantly predicted training-related gains in visuomotor tracking change, measured as change in Success Rate score (r=0.61, p=0.037), supporting the main study hypothesis. Results were specific to the hypothesized ipsilesional motor-parietal circuit, as coherence within other circuits did not predict training-related gains. Analyses were repeated after removing the four subjects with injury to motor or parietal areas; this increased the strength of the association between activity in the circuit of interest and training-related gains. The current study found that (1) Eight sessions of training can significantly improve performance on a visuomotor task in patients with chronic stroke, (2) this improvement can be \u2026"

The time required to set up the telemedicine equipment, position the subject, perform the measurements, and then send the data to the university laboratory was approximately 30 minutes. After six months, several motor and sensory functions showed significant changes. There were significant correlations between changes in remotely-measured leg force and changes in several of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) sensory and motor scores. Changes in balance did not show any significant correlations with changes in the ASIA scores. Intra-rater reliability was better than \u2026"

In this work, we propose to use the functional boxplot to analyze log periodograms of EEG time series data in the spectral domain. The functional bloxplot approach produces a median curve -- which is not equivalent to connecting medians obtained from frequency-specific boxplots. In addition, this approach identifies a functional median, summarizes variability and detects potential outliers. By extending functional boxplots analysis from one-dimensional curves to surfaces, surface boxplots are also used to explore the variation of the spectral power for the alpha (8-12 Hertz) and beta (16-32 Hertz) frequency bands across the brain cortical surface. By using rank-based nonparametric tests, we also investigate the stationarity of EEG traces across an exam acquired during resting-state by comparing the spectrum during the early vs. late phases of a single resting-state EEG exam."

Several lines of evidence suggest a role for the PFO in stroke pathophysiology for some cryptogenic stroke patients, such as those whose PFO is accompanied by a prothrombotic state, atrial septal aneurysm, or lower extremity/pelvic DVT. Diagnostic evaluation of the patient with cryptogenic stroke and PFO is directed at identifying these subgroups. Appropriate therapy for primary and secondary stroke prevention in a subject with a PFO remains unclear given current uncertainties as to the pathophysiological significance of PFO. Additional studies are needed, such as those focused on lower extremity veins or the cardiac interatrial septum, to guide therapy in specific stroke subpopulations."

The BDNF gene contains a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) called Val 66 Met. The Met allele interferes with intracellular BDNF-trafficking, decreases activity-dependent BDNF secretion, and consequently is often associated with a shift from plasticity to stability in neural circuits (Egan et al., 2003). We investigated the behavioral consequences of the presence of the Met allele by comparing how 40 heterozygous subjects with the Val/Met genotype and 35 homozygous subjects with the Val/Val genotype performed on visuomotor tasks (reaching and navigation) under two conditions: normal vision and completely left-right reversed vision. As expected, subjects did not differ in their short-term ability to learn the tasks with normal vision (p= 0.58). Intuitively, it would be expected that homozygous Val/Val subjects with a propensity for greater BDNF-induced activity-dependent plasticity would learn new tasks more quickly than heterozygous Val/Met subjects with decreased BDNF secretion (Gilbert, Li, & Piech, 2009). However, we found the opposite here. When short-term mechanisms of visuomotor adaptation were engaged to compensate for the misalignment of visual and somatomotor information created by the left-right reversal of vision, heterozygous Val/Met subjects learned significantly more quickly than their homozygous Val/Val counterparts (p= 0.027). Our results demonstrate the paradoxical finding that the presence of the Met allele, which is \u2026"

Patients in the subacute stages have also received increased attention. As the processes underlying recovery from stroke have come under investigation, animal and human studies have addressed the goal of using iatrogenic interventions to improve outcome after stroke. This chapter focuses on pharmacologic interventions with this goal. A wide range of outcomes may be seen after stroke (Gresham et al., 1995). A number of factors have been identified as influencing the final outcome (Good, 1994), including age, cognitive impairment, and psychosocial factors. Among the most important predictors are the size of the infarct and the severity of the initial deficit. For example, Nakayama et al.(1994) found that 95% of patients with good neurologic status early after stroke reached a plateau in recovery at 6 weeks, while 11 weeks were required for 95% of patients with poor neurologic status early after stroke. Overall, most recovery occurs in the first 12 weeks, the largest fraction of which is found by week 4. This temporal pattern has been found in a wide range of deficits, including motor, visual, and behavioral (Duncan et al., 1992; Hier et al., 1983). Similari-"

Two separate groups, each with six older male human subjects, were dosed with either form of the drug at 10,000 IU intramuscularly (IM), and followed over a 36-hour period. No significant difference in the serum level of hCG was observed for either preparation of hCG (Peak serum conc.: 316+/-53 vs. 270+/-60 at 12 hours, 311+/-38 vs. 321+/-60 IU/l at 24 hours; AUC: 10,053+/-1,268 vs. 8,793+/-1,768, Pregnyl and Ovitrelle, mean+/-SD, respectively). Additionally, both forms of circulating hCG distributed to the central nervous system (CNS) as manifest by an increased number of subjects whose CSF samples showed detectable levels of hCG in their CSF over a 36-hour period. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the two forms when distribution to the CSF was compared at 36 hours (2.0 and 1.2 IU/l; range 1.9-2.1 and 1-1.4 IU/l for Pregnyl and Ovitrelle, resp.). This preliminary study in normal human volunteers suggests that the two forms of hCG tested, Ovitrelle (R) and Pregnyl (R), when administered IM, distribute in a similar fashion into the circulation and CSF. Consequently, we conclude that these two drugs demonstrate no statistical significant difference with respect to the CSF."

Much of the work has focused on the content of motor therapy. 2 Does adding motor imagery, robotics, brain stimulation, or concomitant pharmacologics help? Is one treatment strategy better than the next? Such investigations focus on qualitative aspects of rehabilitation therapy.

Animal studies have provided insights into the cellular and molecular events essential for these processes. For example, acquisition of a new motor skill is accompanied by changes in gene expression, growth factor levels, neuronal morphology and more.

Using computers for purposes such as paying bills, managing bank accounts, sending emails, etc., which all include typing, is part of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) that stroke patients wish to recover. To date, stroke rehabilitation research has greatly focused on using computer-assisted technology for rehabilitation. However, working with computers as a skill that patients need to recover has been neglected. The conventional human computer interfaces are mouse and keyboard. Using keyboard stays the main challenge for hemiplegic stroke patients because typing is usually a bimanual task. Therefore, we propose an assistive tabletop keyboard which is not only a novel computer interface that is specially designed to facilitate patient-computer interaction but also a rehab medium through which patients practice the desired arm/hand \u2026"

The annual cost exceeds 68 billion dollars in the US. Approximately 795 000 new symptomatic strokes are diagnosed each year in the US. Note that asymptomatic strokes, which are likely a further source of disability [1], occur with a prevalence that is several-fold higher, for example, being present in 22% of adults 65\u201369 years of age [2]. Currently approved stroke therapies are limited to the early hours after stroke. As a result, only 2\u20133% of patients with stroke receive such an intervention [3, 4], although this is improving with time, and rates are higher in selected centers. Nonetheless, many patients who do receive thrombolytic therapy in the acute stage of stroke demonstrate signi\ufb01cant disability months later [5, 6]. Currently approved acute stroke therapies target the vasculature rather than the neural substance of the brain. New therapies are needed that target the brain itself, reduce disability, and can be accessed by a majority of patients with stroke. Repairbased therapies have many candidates that might meet these criteria.Brain repairafterstroke canbede\ufb01nedasa therapeuticstrategywhosegoalisnottosalvageacutelythreatened tissue, butinsteadistopromotetherepairandrestoration of function in surviving tissue.

The maximum value of functional neuroimaging methods such as fMRI is appreciable when applied in association with an established restorative intervention.

Tissue plasminogen activator is approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and genetic variants may impact the efficacy and safety of this drug. In the chronic phase of stroke, several drugs such as L-dopa, fluoxetine and donepezil are under investigation for enhancing rehabilitation therapy, with varying levels of evidence. One potential reason for the mixed efficacy displayed by these drugs may be the influence of genetic factors that were not considered in prior studies. An understanding of the genetics impacting the efficacy of dopaminergic, serotonergic and cholinergic drugs may allow clinicians to target these potential therapies to those patients most likely to benefit.

The goal of this study was to investigate using fMRI which brain networks were activated during a single training session of HG/EA in healthy adults learning to play a computerized pinball-like timing task. Subjects had to trigger a robotic device by flexing their wrist at the correct timing to activate a virtual flipper and hit a falling ball towards randomly positioned targets.

Animal and human studies have focused on perceptual categorization and provide evidence linking brain signals in parietal cortex to the evidence accumulation process. In this exploratory study, we use a task where the dominant contribution to response time is response selection and model the response time data with the drift-diffusion model. EEG measurement during the task show that the readiness potential (RP) recorded over motor areas has timing consistent with the evidence accumulation process. The duration of the RP predicts decision-making time, the duration of evidence \u2026"

Transient ischemic attack is now considered to be an important precursor and long-term risk factor for ischemic stroke. Given the lack of acute therapies for ischemic stroke, currenttreatments focus on secondary prevention through risk-factor management, pharmacotherapy and interventional approaches. As illustrated in this paper, antiplatelet agents (e.g. clopidogrel, aspirin, dipyridamole) are the cornerstone of therapy for prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke."

Given the different functional roles of each hemisphere, we hypothesized that the LHL group should show better motor performance, and, consequently, different brain-behavior relationships, compared to the RHL group. Data from over 2000 stroke patients across 20 sites worldwide has been committed. To date, structural T1-weighted MRIs from n=343 (10 sites) have been analyzed (LHL n=174; RHL n=169).

Key elements of standardization included internet-based training, pilot subject data collection, common TMS equipment across sites, and corrective feedback provided by a standardization administrator. Subsequently, TMS assessments of motor hot spot location, motor threshold, and recruitment curve were conducted in stroke patients on post-stroke Days 5, 30, and 112.

Dr Larry Goldstein summarizes the many clinical trials conducted on the effects of d-amphetamine in stroke survivors. This drug has been repeatedly shown to be beneficial in animal models, especially when combined with behavioral experience. However, results of clinical trials have been quite variable, possibly related to differences in dosing regimens, timing with respect to physiotherapy, or other factors related to stroke severity.

Though the corticospinal tract may be  damaged, function may persist via intact intracortical connections. We  probed motor cortex function using paradigms unrelated to genesis of  paretic limb movement. Seven patients with chronic post-stroke  hemiparesis, including total hand plegia, were studied with functional  MRI (fMRI). Brain activation was achieved by alternating between rest  and one of several stimuli. For the plegic hand, stimuli were passive  index finger movement, or viewing active movements; for the non-plegic  hand, active or passive index finger movement. Brain activation maps  (p<.001) were generated, after which anatomical landmarks were used to  identify regions of interest within non-infarcted tissue. Tasks were  rehearsed before fMRI, during which surface EMG leads were placed on 5  muscles \u2026"

Introduction Myelitis is a disorder of the spinal cord which produces sensory and motor deficits. and is often mflammarory in nature. Resolution of inflammation may be associated with a wide range in degree of clinical recovery. While some return of function is likely due to the reduction of abnormalities at the level of the spinal cord, reorganization of cerebral cortex may also contribute.

Important gains have been realized in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, where thrombolytic and catheter-based reperfusion therapies can substantially improve long-term behavioral outcomes. However, most patients with a new stroke are not eligible for such therapies because of delays in diagnosis or hemorrhagic etiology, for example, and many who are treated nonetheless have substantial long-term disability. Additional classes of poststroke therapy are needed.An emerging branch of stroke therapeutics targets neural repair. Such restorative therapies are introduced after strokerelated injury is fixed and therefore do not aim to modify the initial insult. Instead, the strategy is to improve outcomes by promoting favorable clinical neuroplasticity within surviving neural elements. 1 Many categories of brain repair therapy are under study, including small molecules \u2026"

                "abstract": "Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability in the United States and many other countries. Stroke can cause deficits in a number of neurologic domains, most commonly in the motor system (1, 2). In most patients, the time when spontaneous behavioral recovery is seen is the first three months following a stroke (3, 4)\u2014though this time period might be longer for neglect, aphasia, and other cognitive areas (5\u20139). However, for most patients, behavioral restitution during this period of spontaneous recovery is incomplete, and significant impairment and disability remain.There is a wide range in the severity of enduring deficits after stroke. Many factors have been examined as predictors. For example, severity of initial deficits has been found to be a strong predictor of final behavioral outcome, with some patients having mild-moderate initial stroke deficits and showing an excellent prognosis, but with others having severe baseline stroke deficits and showing a more variable recovery (10). In one study, a relative improvement of the initial motor score of about 20% in the first four weeks after stroke was associated with good outcome (11)."

We explored the validity  of two such methods by comparing patient self-assessments with standard  neurologic evaluations. Patients with an ischemic stroke were asked to  rate stroke-affected arm use for 10 motor tasks, from Motor Activity  Log (MAL). Next, each was asked to rate difficulty in using the  stroke-affected hand for the 5 hand function tasks from the Stroke  Impact Scale (SIS). Neurological exam was performed, then scoring on  NIH Stroke Scale, arm motor Fugl-Meyer scale, and, for each arm, Purdue  Pegboard test. Self-assessments were compared with neurologic  evaluations using Spearman rank correlation test. Thirty three patients  were studied, with mean age 63 years and mean time post-stroke 80 days.  Of these, 13 reported no hand use and 5 reported full return of hand  use to \u2026"

This study evaluated robotic assistance during finger movement training. Functional MRI (fMRI) was acquired at baseline to understand predictors of treatment gains.Methods: Patients with chronic stroke underwent a baseline fMRI scan, alternating rest with affected-side finger movements similar to those made during robotic therapy. Next, subjects received therapy 3 hr/wk for 3 weeks using FINGER (Finger Individuating Grasp Exercise Robot), with which subjects moved their paretic index and middle fingers to play a musical game similar to GuitarHero. FINGER used an assistance-as-needed algorithm to facilitate completion of grasping movements, which increased sensory feedback without altering voluntary motor output. Participants were randomized to receive High Assistance (to insure 85% success) or Low Assistance (55% success).Results: 30 subjects (mean age 58 yr; baseline Fugl-Meyer 46 out of 66; 37 mo post-stroke) completed the study. Significant gains were found in the primary outcome measure, change in Box & Blocks (B&B) score (23 to 25.5, p< 0.0001). There was no difference between High and Low Assistance groups in the primary endpoint (p= 0.65), though some secondary outcomes favored High Assistance. The fMRI scans found that greater treatment gains were associated with higher laterality index in primary sensory cortex, indicating greater boost in B&B score over time with higher pretreatment balance of activation towards ipsilesional rather than contralesional sensory cortex; laterality index in primary \u2026"

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Foot-drop commonly affects gait after stroke, and current physiotherapy is incompletely effective. Orthoses are often used but benefits disappear on removal. The post-stroke brain has enormous potential to undergo plasticity in support of behavioral recovery. The current study builds on this, using an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) to control a functional electrical stimulation (FES) system. Here, motor signals from intact motor cortex are detected then directly applied to the paretic limb to move it, bypassing the stroke. This reinforcement of motor cortex activation with supramaximal neuromuscular stimulation may promote Hebbian learning and lead to enduring changes in CNS organization and gait. The current report describes the safety of this system.METHODS: An integrated BCI-FES system for ankle dorsiflexion was developed by the authors. EEG was recorded as subjects alternated between idling and attempted paretic foot dorsiflexion for 10 mins. A prediction model was generated from this data and used to classify online EEG into idling or dorsiflexion states. This model facilitates brain control of the FES device by producing dorsiflexion when a subject\u2019s intent to dorsiflex is detected. Subjects operated the BCI-FES system by idling or attempting to elicit BCI-FES mediated dorsiflexion in response to alternating 10-sec cues. Each run was 200 sec long and was repeated over 1-2 hours, with breaks. Subjects underwent 3 weekly sessions.RESULTS: Two patients with stroke (ages 38-60, 22-25 mo post-stroke, NIHSS score 4-9), who had foot-drop for which each used a commercial FES \u2026"

The current study tested the hypothesis that administration of this two compound regimen, initiated 24 hours after MCAo stroke, improves long-term behavioral outcome. METHODS: Long-Evans rats received 90 min MCAo by retrograde insertion of an intraluminal suture coated with poly-L-lysine. At 24 h from MCAo onset, 46 rats were randomized into 4 treatment groups in a double-blinded manner: hCG+ EPO (3 IM doses hCG at 300 IU/kg over 5 days, followed by 3 IV doses EPOGEN at 1440 IU/kg over 3 days), hCG+ saline in same schedule, saline+ EPO in same schedule, or neither drug (saline+ saline). Primary endpoint was Composite Neurological Score (0-12 points, O= normal), measured 60 min into occlusion, then at 1 h post-infarct, 24 h post-infarct, and a total of 11 times until 12 weeks post-infarct. RESULTS: Body and cranial temperature showed no significant group differences between groups. The Composite Neurological Score was different over time across treatment groups (p< 0.056, repeated measures ANOVA time X treatment group). Pairwise testing of groups found that the hCG+ EPO group had significanUy lower scores at 8/10 post-stroke time points as compared to saline+ saline. The hCG+ EPO group scores were lower than scores in the single-drug (hCG+ saline and saline+ EPO) groups in all but one instance but significanUy so at only 2 time points. The 2 single-drug treatment arms did not significanUy differ at \u2026"

Changes in intra- and interhemispheric connectivity have been reported but most studies have focused on individuals with limited motor impairment. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine connectivity between motor regions during paretic hand movement in a population with a range of motor impairment after stroke.Methods: Seventeen right-hand dominant individuals with hemispheric stroke (age 58.7\u00b113.9; UE FM 34.3\u00b112.3; days post-stroke 154.6\u00b1101.8) underwent functional MRI during paretic hand grasp/release.

                "abstract": "Stroke remains a leading cause of disability in the United States and many other countries, with the rate of survival increasing in recent years. Thrombolytic therapy has been approved for the treatment of acute stroke, but only 5.2% of Americans receive intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)(1), and approximately half of those who are treated and survive show longterm disability (2). Stroke can cause deficits in a number of neurological domains, most commonly in the motor system (3, 4). In most patients, the time when spontaneous behavioral recovery is seen is the first three months following a stroke (5, 6), though this time period might be longer for neglect, aphasia, and other cognitive areas (7\u201311).Although many patients show some degree of spontaneous recovery during the months after a stroke, the degree of this recovery is generally incomplete. In addition, the heterogeneous nature of stroke means that not all stroke survivors stand to achieve the same behavioral gains, making recovery highly variable. The best measures with which to establish prognosis and response to treatment are undetermined. The severity of initial deficits has traditionally been the measure most often used to predict the outcome after stroke (12\u201315). A number of other measures have been found to predict the degree of spontaneous recovery after stroke, including age (16), sensory or motorevoked potentials (17\u201320), cognitive impairment and accompanying neurological deficits (21), and many more. That the list is so long is not surprising, however, given the large number of factors that influence brain function after stroke (22)(Table 8.1). However, a large \u2026"

Motor imagery activates movement execution circuits as well as brain areas related to cognitive aspects of movement training, such as planning or functional relevance. Movement execution and imagery might work synergistically in activating the motor system after stroke, but to date have only been studied separately. The current study examined the neural correlates of imagery in conjunction with execution, hypothesizing that the combined approach would increase brain activation in areas important to movement training.METHODS: Seven patients with chronic right hemiparetic stroke were studied, with age 55.1\u00b1.3 years (mean\u00b1SD), 13.1\u00b112.8 mo post-stroke, and arm motor Fugl-Meyer score 50.9\u00b111.9.

In some cases, it may be advantageous to use autologous MSC, but the feasibility of quickly generating sufficient MSC for autologous therapy has not been established. We investigated the feasibility of rapidly generating large numbers of autologous, early passage, MSC as a prerequisite for the clinical investigation of MSC in human ischemic stroke. Bone marrow (25\u201335 mL) was collected from 8 healthy volunteers under an IRB-approved protocol; a mononuclear cell (mnc) fraction prepared by ficol density gradient, a portion of the mnc fraction was suspended in low glucose DMEM with 20% pre-screened FBS and plated in T175 culture flasks at 0.2\u20130.4 \u00d7 106 mnc/cm2; maintained at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator; non-adherent cells were removed at 48 h and a portion of the cells were passaged when 80% confluent into \u2026"

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 1 in 15 deaths attributable to stroke, and the second leading cause worldwide. Approximately 85% of patients in the United States survive an acute stroke, living an average of 7 yr thereafter. Most are left with significant disability (Gresham et al., 1995; Rathore et al., 2002), reducing activities and participation.Stroke can affect all aspects of brain function. The nature and severity of poststroke deficits vary widely. Over the weeks to months following a stroke, most patients do show some spontaneous improvement in those behaviors affected by stroke (Duncan et al., 1992; Hier et al., 1983; Kertz & McCabe, 1977). However, this recovery is highly variable and generally incomplete. As a result, stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States and many other countries."

Pilot studies of brain mapping in patients with MS and myelitis suggest that several motor cortex regions are organized differently than in healthy controls. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of cortical plasticity in reducing disability among patients with MS. If further evidence supports a role for cortical remodeling in recovery from MS attacks, then treatments targeting the processes underlying cortical plasticity, such as growth factors currently being evaluated in stroke models, may represent new \u2026"

Previous studies have found  paradoxical embolism to be uncommon in stroke, but few have focussed on  patients with cryptogenic stroke. We therefore evaluated pelvic veins  and leg veins in this population. METHODS: Eighteen patients  (median age 45 years) with a cryptogenic brain ischemic event (stroke  16, TIA 2) underwent magnetic resonance venography (MRV). Evaluation  consisted of time-of-flight (TOF) and phase contrast images through the  pelvis. A positive MRV was defined as an intravascular decrease in  signal intensity at least 15 millimeters (mm) in length contacting the  wall of a vein and showing matching abnormalities on both pulse  sequences. Lower extremity venous duplex examination was also performed  in 17 \u2026"

The electroencephalogram (EEG) changes immediately after brain ischemia, and advances in EEG technology enable rapid acquisition in the acute care setting. We hypothesized that EEG data increase the accuracy with which patients are correctly classified as having acute stroke or not, and so performed a study in the Emergency Department (ED) as an initial step towards evaluating prehospital utility of EEG.Methods: Patients with suspected stroke in a comprehensive stroke center ED underwent a 3 min EEG using a wireless, dry-electrode system; data were analyzed offline. A model was developed to classify patients as stroke/TIA vs non-stroke using a training set of 60 randomly selected patients. The model was then tested in an independent validation cohort of 40 new patients. EEG variables were selected using Lasso regression \u2026"

Barriers to outcome measure training include availability of standardized materials and time to train, plus wide geographic distribution of trial personnel. To address these, an online training and certification program based on NIHSS testing was developed and implemented for the Fugl Meyer Motor Assessment (FMMA) in support of multisite stroke recovery trials.Methods: This program includes Fugl Meyer Arm (FMA) and Leg (FML) components, runs on a web host, and is based on a valid, reliable approach to FMMA testing known to decrease variance in scoring (See et al, NNR, 2013;27:732-741). The website hosts training courses, reference manuals, video patient cases for formal certification testing plus 3 rounds of recertification; each round has 2 separate patients.

                "abstract": "The most difficult clinical questions in stroke rehabilitation are \u201cWhat is this patient\u2019s potential for recovery?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the best rehabilitation strategy for this person, given her/his clinical profile?\u201d Without answers to these questions, clinicians struggle to make decisions regarding the content and focus of therapy, and researchers design studies that inadvertently mix participants who have a high likelihood of responding with those who do not. Developing and implementing biomarkers that distinguish patient subgroups will help address these issues and unravel the factors important to the recovery process. The goal of the present paper is to provide a consensus statement regarding the current state of the evidence for stroke recovery biomarkers. Biomarkers of motor, somatosensory, cognitive and language domains across the recovery timeline post-stroke are considered; with focus on brain structure and function, and exclusion of blood markers and genetics. We provide evidence for biomarkers that are considered ready to be included in clinical trials, as well as others that are promising but not ready and so represent a developmental priority. We conclude with an example that illustrates the utility of biomarkers in recovery and rehabilitation research; demonstrating how the inclusion of a biomarker may enhance future clinical trials. In this way, we propose a way forward for when and where we can include biomarkers to advance the efficacy of the practice of, and research into, rehabilitation and recovery after stroke."

Evaluating such therapies in clinical trials introduces a number of complexities. Some of these are directly comparable to issues encountered in trials of acute stroke therapies, such as the need to stratify, train sites in endpoint measurement, and carefully select entry criteria in relation to preclinical study design. Other issues are more often encountered in the context of restorative therapies, such as the need for behavioral reinforcement and the utility of examining treatment benefits separately across different neural systems. The latter point emphasizes the potential importance of modality-specific endpoints.

Secondary: examine immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, neurophysiology, and motor function.BACKGROUND: Restorative therapies improve stroke outcome with a wide time window. After stroke, levels of the axon outgrowth inhibition molecule myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) increase. Blockade of MAG promotes axon growth. GSK249320 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against MAG that has a disabled Fc region to prevent toxicity, crosses BBB, neutralizes MAG-mediated inhibition, promotes axon growth, and reduces oligodendrocyte death.DESIGN/METHODS: Patients with mild-moderate stroke and a weak arm, leg, or both were randomized to IV GSK249320 (1, 5, or 15 mg/kg per infusion, in escalating cohorts) vs. placebo.

The ease of isolation and immunoprivileged status of MSC have stimulated numerous preclinical stroke studies. We performed a meta-analysis to estimate study quality, size of behavioral effects, and the impact of variables such as timing of MSC administration in relation to stroke onset.METHODS: Studies of MSC and stroke were identified through PubMed and Web of Science. Studies of hemorrhage, not in English, or using modified MSC were excluded. A Quality Score was determined for each study, estimating methodological quality using 10 criteria derived from STAIR guidelines, with higher Quality Scores reflecting greater compliance with issues such as randomization and outcome blinding.

Polymorphisms in the BDNF gene correlate with memory capacity and synaptic plasticity (Egan et al, 2003; Kleim et al, 2006), and may predict capacity for visual-motor learning and motor map plasticity (Pearson-Fuhrhop et al, 2009). Presently, we investigate the effects of short-term adaptation to left-right visual field reversal on visuo-motor task performance with two BDNF genotypes with different propensities for neural plasticity. Methods. The first hour was used to review and sign consent forms, undergo a blood draw for genetic screening for the BDNF val 66 met polymorphism, and complete a series of short questionnaires. Subjects then spent an hour performing baseline visuo-motor tasks wearing a pair of Control Goggles with a restricted field of view, but no other visual alterations \u2026"

                "abstract": "The neurological examination is a time-honored physician skill that is honed by neurologists and a key component of the clinical assessment of a patient with suspected stroke. The emphasis of the neurological examination may vary among patients and differences in evaluation are influenced by the patient\u2019s history or other findings detected prior to the physical examination. Unfortunately, none of the abnormalities found on neurological examination are specific for stroke; other acute brain illnesses can produce the same neurological findings. Besides defining the neurological deficits, clinical issues that are addressed by the examination are also influenced by the time since the stroke. The initial examination helps localize the lesion and provides clinical\u2013anatomical correlations to help answer the question:\u201cWhere is the stroke?\u201d This question is answered by the pattern of neurological impairments and because specific combinations of signs point to a defined brain location (Bogousslavsky et al., 1988; Bogousslavsky, 1991; Donnan et al., 1993; Vuilleumier et al., 1995; Tatu et al., 1996, 1998). In addition, the baseline neurological examination provides information that addresses the question:\u201cHow severe is the stroke?\u201d In general, the types and severity of neurological deficits correlate with the size of the brain injury and thus the seriousness of the vascular event. This information affects decisions about acute treatment and may provide prognostic guidance. Subsequent examinations may be performed to detect neurological worsening or improvement. In particular, detection of increased neurological impairments affects management, including \u2026"

A single nucleotide polymorphism with a valine-to-methonine substitution of condon 66 (val66met) in humans is associated with memory impairments and abnormal morphology in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. To evaluate the effects of the val66met polymorphism on experience-dependent plasticity in the human motor cortex, 9 healthy subjects with the Val/Val, 11 with the Val/Met, and 6 with the Met/Met polymorphism were studied with transcranial magnetic stimulation before and after motor training (Kleim and others 2006). Subjects with the Val/Val genotype had a 3 [cm. sup. 2] increase in cortical map area following motor training of the first index finger, but subjects with the Val/Met or Met/Met genotypes showed no change.

                "abstract": "The study also raises a number of important questions. The fraction of patients with stroke for whom these results hold promise remains to be determined. The requirement that a patient demonstrate 10 of active wrist extension is used to increase the likelihood that the affected arm will improve after therapy, but this also excludes a large fraction of the stroke population. Estimates vary, but only 6.3% of patients screened in this trial and 18% of those screened in a separate study4 were ultimately found to be eligible to receive constraint-induced therapy. A more theoretical estimate is that 20% to 25% of patients with stroke might be eligible. 5 The exact component (s) of constraint-induced therapy critical to the observed clinical gains requires further clarification as noted by the authors. Thus, the contribution of intense practice by the affected limb needs to be disentangled from the contribution of constraining the good limb. Note that historically, however, such uncertainty has not prevented implementation of therapy in the setting of vascular disease. For example, the extent to which aspirin\u2019s preventative effects are attributable to antiplatelet versus antiinflammatory activities remains to be fully clarified, yet this therapy is widely prescribed to patients with stroke. 6 Interpretation of the EXCITE trial is also complicated by the fact that the active and the control groups varied by both the amount and the nature of therapy. This leaves open the question as to how much of the observed benefit in the constraint-induced therapy group was attributable to simply receiving more hours of intervention than that provided to subjects in the customary care group. Also, the \u2026"

Limited treatment options exist for patients with chronic stroke and substantial functional de? cits. The current study examined safety and preliminary ef? cacy estimates of intravenous allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in this population.Methods\u2014Entry criteria included ischemic stroke> 6 months prior and substantial impairment (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score= 6) and disability. Enrollees received a single intravenous dose of allogeneic ischemia-tolerant mesenchymal stem cells. Phase 1 used a dose-escalation design (3 tiers, n= 5 each). Phase 2 was an expanded safety cohort. The primary end point was safety over 1-year. Secondary end points examined behavioral change.Results\u2014In phase 1 (n= 15), each dose (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 million cells/kg body weight) was found safe, so phase 2 subjects (n= 21) received 1.5 million cells/kg. At baseline, subjects (n= 36) averaged 4.2\u00b14.6 years poststroke, age 61.1\u00b110.8 years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 8 (6.5\u201310), and Barthel Index 65\u00b129. Two were lost to follow-up, one was withdrawn and 2 died (unrelated to study treatment). Of 15 serious adverse events, none was possibly or probably related to study treatment. Two mild adverse events were possibly related to study treatment, a urinary tract infection and intravenous site irritation. Treatment was safe based on serial exams, electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, and computed tomography scans of chest/abdomen/pelvis. All behavioral end points showed signi? cant gains over the 12-months of follow-up. For example, Barthel Index \u2026"
