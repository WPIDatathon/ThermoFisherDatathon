        "Pierce SCX Spin Columns": "ion exchange IEX resins are rigid polymeric beads with covalent surface chemistries which enable easier handling and packing while offering superior physical and chemical stability resulting in a robust manufacturing process combine high binding capacity with a salt tolerance of up to NaCl deamidation and succinimide formation cation exchange and anion exchange chromatography binding the target washing the column and eluting the target is called bind/elute mode and is often applied in intermediate purification steps for example in downstream processing of antibodies Anion Exchange Chromatography is an integral part of most plasma protein purification platforms such as Factor VIII purification equilibration of the stationary phase When equilibrium is reached all stationary phase charged groups are bound with exchangeable counter ions such as chloride or sodium The pH and ionic strength of the start buffer are selected to ensure proteins of interest bind to the medium membrane protein purification Pierce SCX Spin Columns Strong cation exchange membrane Binding capacity Salt tolerance Realize shorter diffusion times higher protein recovery and intact biological activity of eluted samples with Pierce Strong Cation Exchange and Strong Anion Exchange spin columns Unlike resin based column chromatography these columns utilize ion exchange chromatography to separate molecules based on differences in their accessible surface charges Pierce Strong Cation Exchange and Strong Anion Exchange spin columns use membrane adsorption as the chromatographic method of choice to fractionate proteins based on their charge differences The column matrix has a highly porous structure with pores larger than nm giving proteins ready accessibility to the membranes charged ligands These adsorptive membranes maintain high efficiencies at high flow rates and during fractionation of large biomolecules with small diffusivities Ion chromatography is widely preferred in the prefractionation or purification of a target protein from crude biological samples Interactions between molecules and active sites on the ion exchange

        "POROS XS Resin": "Antibody purification involves isolation of antibody from serum polyclonal antibody ascites fluid or from the culture supernatant of a hybridoma cell line monoclonal antibody Purification methods range from very crude to highly specific The level of purification necessary to obtain usable antibody depends upon the intended applications for the antibody Antibodies may be purified by class eg IgG without regard to antigen specificity or affinity purified to an immobilized antigen that is antibody specific ligands and formats to purify total or specific antibodies from serum ascites fluid or tissue culture supernatant Our portfolio is designed to meet smallscale screening to largescale bioprocess needs magnetic beads loose resin spin columns and kits FPLC cartridges and well filter plates enable antibody purification Protein A Protein A alkaline stable Protein G Protein A/G Protein L Agarose Magnetic beads POROS resin Melon gel The separation of antibodies from complex mixtures can be achieved using chromatographic or nonchromatographic techniques The purification of antibodies using chromatography involves the separation of antibodies or antibodyderived molecules present in complex mixtures by passing them through a solid phase eg silica resin or beads monolithic columns or cellulose membranes and allowing the antibodies to bind or pass through depending on whether bindandelute or flowthrough chromatographic methods are employed Chromatographic methodologies can incorporate different separation techniques such as affinitytag binding ionexchange sizeexclusion chromatography or immunoaffinity chromatography However in a concerted effort to become less reliant on chromatographybased separations owing to the high cost of largescale production nonchromatographicbased techniques such as precipitation flocculation crystallization filtration and aqueous twophase partitioning are now becoming more popular This review details current chromatographic and nonchromatographic methodologies used for the purification of antibodies and expands on technological advancements and practical uses that have recently been reported POROS XS Resin POROS XS Resin Strong cation exchange SCX resin Surface charge Format Binding capacity Salt tolerance loose resin POROS XS Strong Cation Exchange Resin is the first high capacity high resolution resin that allows loading to more than mg/mL capacity in the presence of up to mS/cm NaCl while delivering unprecedented separation capability A major improvement on traditional cation exchangers POROS XS resin sets the standard for cation exchange chromatography Dynamic binding capacity leads to reduced column size smaller footprint decreased buffer usage and reduced cycling High resolution supports better product yield and improved impurity clearance Robust salt tolerance allows improved process flexibility alignment and process flow streamlining Low back pressure and linear pressure responses help improve scalability Rigid polymeric bead with covalent surface chemistry makes for easier handling and packing and superior physical and chemical stability resulting in a robust manufacturing process Dynamic binding capacity POROS XS resin has a high binding capacity of more than mg/mL at breakthrough over a broad range of process conditionsHigher dynamic binding capacity was achieved by optimizing the base bead pore structure and surface chemistry High resolution Using an optimized µm particle size POROS XS resin maintains the superior resolving capacity of POROS HS resin while overcoming the challenging impurity levels associated with high titer processes Resolution is consistent across a wide range of operating flow rates and is maintained independent of protein load Robust salt tolerance POROS XS resin has high and consistent protein capacity across a broad range of salt concentrations up to mM NaCl mS/cm conductivity The ability to load columns under higher conductivity reduces or helps eliminate the dilution of column feed streams or the removal of unit operations such as tangential flow filtration The optimized surface ionic capacity of POROS XS resin minimizes competitive binding between the protein of interest and the counter ion resulting in superior salt tolerance Poros Bead Product Line POROS
