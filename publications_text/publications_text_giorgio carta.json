The observed kinetic behavior of all the esterification reactions is found to follow a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism with competitive inhibition by both substrates. The effect of the chain-length of the fatty acids and the alcohols could be correlated to some mechanistic models, in accordance with the calculated kinetic parameters.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsEsterificationCarbonKineticRecommended articlesCited by (0)\u2606Dedicated to Professor Dr Wolf-Dieter Deckwer on the occasion of his 60th birthday.1Present address: University Mohamed V, Ecole Mohammadia d'Ing\u00e9nieurs, G\u00e9nie des Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s, P.O.

Four different sulfopropyl (SP) matrices were synthesized using a neutral agarose base material \u2013 two based on a short ligand chemistry and two obtained by grafting 10 and 40\u00a0kDa dextran polymers. The pore accessibility, determined by inverse size exclusion chromatography (iSEC) with dextran probes, decreases dramatically as a result of the combined effects of crosslinking, dextran grafting, and the introduction of ionic ligands, with pore radii decreasing from 19\u00a0nm for the base matrix to 6.1\u00a0nm for the 40\u00a0kDa dextran-grafted SP-matrix. In spite of this reduction, while the adsorption isotherms were similar, protein uptake rates were greatly increased with the dextran-grafted SP-matrices, compared to SP-matrices based on the short ligand chemistry. The effective pore diffusivities were 4\u201310 times higher than free solution diffusivity for the dextran-grafted matrices, indicating that the charged dextran grafts result in enhanced protein mass transfer rates.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProtein adsorptionMass transferIon exchangeDextran-grafted agaroseRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These ion exchangers are found to have an exceptionally high static adsorption capacity, greater than about 200 mg/cm3, and a rapid uptake kinetics. Being mechanically quite strong, they are suitable for chromatography applications at elevated mobile phase flow-rates. The uptake equilibrium of proteins by these ion exchangers is obtained experimentally and is found to follow the mass action law. Thus, reversible adsorption and desorption of proteins is obtained by varying the solution ionic strength. Batch mass transfer rates in an agitated contactor under favorable uptake conditions are also obtained. The uptake kinetics is controlled by the fluid phase mass transfer resistance for low protein concentrations, and by the intraparticle mass transfer resistance at high protein concentrations. In the latter case, the uptake is quite rapid and nearly complete saturation of particles 49\u201376 \u03bcm in diameter can be obtained in 5 to 10 min. The parameters of a model describing the batch uptake kinetics in these ion exchangers are obtained by comparing experimental results with model predictions.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMass transferIon exchangersStationary phases, LCPreparative chromatographyProteinsAlbuminOvalbuminLactalbuminRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current address: Departamento de Ingegneria Quimica, Universidad de Oviedo, Spain.View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1996 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In all cases, the adsorption equilibrium capacity decreased with increasing salt. However, the adsorption kinetics was strongly influenced by the adsorbent structure and protein characteristics. For the smaller and positively charged lysozyme, the effective pore diffusivity was only weakly dependent on salt for the dextran-free media, but declined sharply with salt for the dextran-grafted materials. For this protein, the dextran grafts enhanced the adsorption kinetics at low salt, but the enhancement vanished at higher salt concentrations. For BSA, which was near its isoelectric point for the experimental conditions studied, the effective diffusivity was low for all materials and almost independent of salt. Finally, for the larger and positively charged IgG, the effective diffusivity varied with salt, reaching an apparent maximum at intermediate concentrations for both dextran-free and dextran-grafted media with the kinetics substantially enhanced by the dextran grafts for these conditions. Microscopic observations of the particles during protein adsorption at low ionic strengths showed transient patterns characterized by sharp adsorption fronts for all materials. A theory taking into account surface or adsorbed phase diffusion with electrostatic coupling of diffusion fluxes is introduced to explain the mechanism for the enhanced adsorption kinetics observed for the positively charged proteins.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProtein adsorptionMass transferIon exchangeDextran-grafted agaroseRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two anion exchangers and a cation exchanger were investigated. As shown in Part I of this work, the two anion exchangers have different morphologies. The first one, BRX-Q, comprises a low-density gel with a matrix of denser polymeric aggregates. While this material has a very low size-exclusion limit for neutral probes, it exhibits an extremely high binding capacity for BSA. The second anion exchanger, BRX-QP, comprises large open pores but has a very low binding capacity. The cation exchanger, BRX-S, also comprises large open pores but exhibits an intermediate capacity; likely as a result of the presence of smaller pores. Dynamic protein uptake experiments showed that the highest mass transfer rates are obtained with BRX-Q. The apparent diffusivity is also highest for this material and increases substantially as the protein concentration is reduced. For these particles, the external film resistance is dominant at very low protein concentrations. Much lower rates and apparent diffusivities are obtained for BRX-QP. Finally intermediate rates and apparent diffusivities are found with BRX-S. The concentration dependence of the apparent pore diffusivity is much less pronounced in this case. The apparently paradoxical result that mass transfer rates are highest for the material with the smallest neutral-probe size-exclusion limit can be explained in terms of a general conceptual model where parallel pore and adsorbed-phase diffusion paths exist in these particles. In the first case, adsorbed phase diffusion in gel pores is dominant, while in the second transport is dominated by diffusion in a macroporous network. In the third case, both contributions are important. The conceptual model provides an accurate prediction of the breakthrough behavior of columns packed with these media using independently determined rate parameters. Dynamic binding capacities of 80\u2013140 mg/ml were observed for BSA on BRX-Q in ca. 1.5 cm columns operated at 300\u2013900 cm/h in agreement with theoretical predictions.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsDiffusionIon exchangersPolymeric gelsAdsorptionStationary phases, LCKeywordsProteinsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The adsorbent materials investigated include both highly hydrophobic adsorbents as well as functionalized, more hydrophilic ones. The adsorption isotherms approach the ideal Langmuir form. For the amino acids considered in this work, the isotherms are essentially independent of pH, but they vary significantly with temperature and with the addition of alcohols. Heats of adsorption for phenylalamine are obtained from van't Hoff plots of the Henry's law constant limit of the Langmuir isotherm and they are found to be larger for the more hydrophobic adsorbents. However, adsorption affinities for this amino acid are larger for the more hydrophilic sorbents, indicating a significant entropic contribution for the adsorption on these materials.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)Copyright \u00a9 1996 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The proteins lactalbumin, myoglobin, ovalbumin, BSA, conalbumin, IgG, and ferritin with molecular masses ranging from 15\u2008000 to 450\u2008000 were investigated. At high salt concentration (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl containing 500 mM NaCl), only the smaller proteins lactalbumin and myoglobin gained access to a significant portion of the particle volume. The larger proteins were nearly completely excluded, in agreement with the results obtained for neutral macromolecules. By contrast, at low salt concentration (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl), the adsorption capacity was very large (280\u2013400 mg/ml of particle volume) for all the proteins studied except for ferritin, for which the capacity was much lower. This suggests that, provided the solute is not too large, the favorable electrostatic interaction overcomes the size exclusion effect. Adsorption rate measurements showed that mass transfer rates are also quite fast at low salt concentration. Effective diffusivities were determined by matching model and experimental results and were found to decrease substantially as the protein size increased. As previously observed, the homogeneous diffusion model was found to predict the experimentally observed trends with respect to protein concentration and boundary layer mass transfer effects.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsPolymeric gelsMass transferStationary phases, LCKeywordsProteinsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A model for linear chromatography is used in the analysis for particles that contain both throughpores where diffusive and convective transport occur and purely diffusive micropores. The key concept is that of a convection-augmented intraparticle diffusivity, which depends only on the intraparticle Peclet number, \u03bb. The separation performance is expressed in terms of both resolution and peak profiles at the column outlet. It is shown that, for given operating conditions, the separation enhancement obtained for intraparticle convection is dependent on the relative importance of throughpore and micropore diffusion rates. In the absence of micropore resistances, the resolution is always increased by intraparticle convection. The latter, however, is shown to have no effect on the separation performance when micropore diffusional resistances are dominant. Relationships necessary to assess the importance of these effects for linear chromatography conditions are provided.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1993 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Quantitative relationships are provided to relate the intraparticle flow to the permeability of the particles and the bed properties. A theoretical development focused on the response of the bed to pulse injections of inert and linearly sorbed solutes shows how intraparticle convection enhances intraparticle transport, improving the efficiency of chromatographic operations. The theory developed is consistent with experimental results obtained for low molecular weight solutes and proteins with a commercial large-pore support. For this system, the HETP is observed to increase linearly at low flow rates, leveling off to a plateau at high flow rates when intraparticle transport becomes dominated by convection.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordschromatographyintraparticle convectionresidence time distributionHETPproteinsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1992 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The model includes the effects of pore diffusional resistance within the adsorbent particles as well as resistance to mass transfer in the external film. The solution is developed for systems exhibiting linear equilibrium in the form of an infinite series which allows the calculation of chromatographic response curves for periodic, square-wave changes in concentration at the entrance of the chromatographic column. The series is rapidly convergent for typical chromatographic conditions, and it can be integrated term by term to obtain expressions that allow direct calculation of separation performance parameters such as product cut purity and per cent recovery.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)Copyright \u00a9 1988 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The analysis is restricted to the case of a pulse input of a linearly adsorbed tracer and is based on the assumption that the adsorbent pellets consist of equally sized microparticles with intercalating throughpores. Simultaneous diffusion and convection in the throughpores and diffusion in the microparticles are taken into account for slab-shaped and spherical pellets and expressions for the height equivalent to a theoretical plate are derived. On this basis, a criterion is developed to determine under what conditions transport limitations is purely diffusive pores influence the performance of chromatographic processes utilizing permeable particles.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)Copyright \u00a9 1993 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In this work, we present a local equilibrium model to predict the magnitude and duration of these pH transients. The model equations are solved by the method of characteristics and by numerical simulations using an equilibrium-dispersive model. By incorporating an explicit description of the dissociation of the weakly ionogenic groups in the resin, we show that counterion binding in the column can be predicted for different buffer systems based on a single experimental resin titration curve without having to resort to empirically defined adsorption equilibrium constants. Model predictions based on these assumptions are found to be in excellent agreement with experimental results obtained for three different resins containing varying concentrations of weak acid groups. Four common buffer systems, acetate, citrate, MES, and phosphate are considered with both step and gradient changes in salt concentration at pH 5.5. Each buffer yields a different pH excursion behavior. We demonstrate that when the counterion concentration is kept constant in each of these buffers, which is needed to attain identical protein adsorption behavior, the magnitude of the pH transitions occurring during salt steps is nearly independent of the buffer system. On the other hand, the duration of the pH transitions is smallest for MES suggesting that this buffer system is preferable where pH variations are to be prevented.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordspH transitionsWeak acid resinsCharacteristicsSalts stepsGradient elutionRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Under conditions of intraparticle mass transfer control, mass transfer rates in the shallow bed were the same as those measured when the sorbent particles were suspended in an agitated vessel, indicating that the intraparticle mass transfer rate is independent of the hydrodynamic conditions outside the particle and consistent with a purely diffusional transport mechanism. The predictability of breakthrough curves based on kinetic parameters obtained from batch experiments is assessed by comparing experimental results for different proteins with predictions of a model which incorporates the external film resistance and intraparticle diffusion. This model is in excellent agreement with the experimental results even at extremely high mobile phase velocities. Very large dynamic capacities are obtained with columns packed with Q-HyperD media as a result of their high static capacity, rapid uptake kinetics and mechanical strength that prevents compression of the particles even at elevated flow-rates.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMass transferPreparative chromatographyIon exchangersBreakthrough curvesStationary phases, LCProteinsAlbuminOvalbuminLactalbuminRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current address: Departamento de Ingegneria Quimica, Universidad de Oviedo, Spain.View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1996 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The Davies equation was used to extrapolate the dissociation constants to zero ionic strength. The pK values of the carboxylic acid attached to the \u03b1-carbon and the pK of the carboxylic acid on the side chain of glutamic acid were almost independent of temperature. Conversely, the pK values of the amino groups attached to the \u03b1-carbon and those on the side chain of the basic amino acids varied substantially with temperature. van\u2019t Hoff type plots of the pK values showed linear relationships indicating that the standard enthalpy changes of reaction are constant over this range of temperatures.IntroductionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsConclusionsAuthor InformationReferencesAmino acids are important industrial products manufactured on the scale of 1 million metric tons per year. (1) They find applications in many areas including foods, animal feed supplements, and intravenous formulations, as well as chemical intermediates in pharmaceutical manufacturing. As is well-known, amino acids are amphoteric and dissociate in aqueous solution forming positively charged, zwitterionic, and negatively charged forms. Knowledge of the speciation of amino acids among these different forms is critical for many practical calculations. For example, modeling and design of unit operations for the industrial separation and purification of amino acids by ion exchange require a description of the dissociation behavior in solution to predict ion exchange equilibrium (e.g., see Saunders et al., (2) Wang et al., (3) Helfferich, (4) Bellot et al., (5) and Nagai and Carta (6)). Crystallization modeling and design also require knowledge of speciation into the different ionized forms to predict solubility as a function of solution composition. (7)The dissociation constants for most amino acids are generally available in the literature. (8, 9) However, most literature values are limited to room temperature (298 K) and low ionic strength conditions that deviate substantially from those frequently encountered in practical industrial manufacturing processes. The effect of ionic strength on the dissociation constant of several amino acids has been reported by Rey et al. (10) although only at 298 K. Various measurements of thermodynamic properties of aqueous solutions of amino acids have also been reported as a function of temperature in the geochemical literature, including molar volumes, (11) densities, (12) and molar heat capacities. (13) Amino acid dissociation constants have also been reported as a function of temperature. However, most of these measurements are limited to only a few, neutral amino acids or are for temperature ranges that fall outside those used in the industrial processing of amino acids. For example, Robinson and Stokes (14) reported the temperature dependence of the dissociation constants of aspartic acid, glycine, leucine, iso-leucine, proline, serine, threonine, and valine. These authors used the integrated Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation with a temperature-dependent enthalpy function to fit the measured apparent dissociation constants. Other authors (15-17) have also investigated the effect of temperature, but these studies have also been limited to glycine, alanine, and aminobutyric acid. More recently, Borst et al. (18) measured the temperature dependence of the dissociation constants of phenylalanine. These authors found that the pK of the carboxyl group of this amino acid is nearly independent of temperature while the pK of the amino group decreases substantially with temperature. The effect of temperature was described accurately with the integrated Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation using a constant enthalpy over the temperature range from (278 to 358) K. Finally, Clarke et al. (19) have reported the temperature dependence of the carboxylic acid dissociation constant for glycine, alanine, and proline at temperatures between (150 and 250) \u00b0C.The objectives of this contribution are 2-fold. The first is to extend the measurement of the effect of temperature on the dissociation constants to the amino acids lysine, histidine, arginine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Data for threonine and phenylalanine are also obtained to provide a consistent set of data and for comparison with previous work. The second objective is to determine the effect of ionic strength varied up to about 1 mol\u00b7kg\u22121 on the dissociation constants at different temperatures. Apparent dissociation constants are obtained by potentiometric titrations with activity coefficient corrections based on the Davies equation. Values of the enthalpy of dissociation are obtained by fitting the data with the Gibbs\u2212Helmoltz equation.Experimental SectionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsConclusionsAuthor InformationReferences ChemicalsThe amino acids lysine, histidine, arginine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and threonine were obtained from Ajinomoto Co., Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) with purity in excess of 99 %. Since lysine and histidine form hydrochloride salts, both free amino acids and HCl forms were used in the titration experiments. Titrants were certified hydrochloric acid normal solution and sodium hydroxide normal solution purchased from Wako Junyaku Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). ProcedureA model AT-310J potentiometric automatic titrator obtained from Kyoto Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan) was used for the measurements in conjunction with a model H-171 pH glass electrode with inner silver chloride polar and a model R-171 reference electrode also from Kyoto Electronics Manufacturing. Both electrodes had ceramic wick junctions and were filled with 3.3 M KCl. Titration end points were determined at the inflections of the first derivative of the potentiometric function. Half-equivalence points were then used to obtain the apparent dissociation constants.The procedure was as follows. Free amino acids or HCl salts for lysine or histidine were first dissolved in pure water in a 300 mL magnetically stirred vessel immersed in a thermostatted water bath. The pH meter of the automatic titrator was calibrated with two buffers at each temperature using 0.05 M potassium hydrogen phthalate (pH 4.00) and 0.025 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.86) for the acidic region and 0.01 M sodium borate (pH 9.18) and 0.025 M sodium phosphate (pH 6.86) for the alkaline region. Potentiometric titrations were then conducted adding either standardized HCl or NaOH. At the half-equivalence point, the apparent pK values were recorded along with the volume of titrant added to calculate the ionic strengths. Temperature was maintained constant by immersing the titrator syringe and the titrant vessels in the same thermostatic bath. Solution densities were determined with a model DA-30 (Kyoto Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) electrical density meter and used to convert molarities into molalities for the calculation of ionic strength. However, because of the relatively small temperature difference and fairly dilute conditions, the difference between molarity and molality was negligible. TheoryDissociation of the basic amino acids considered in this work (lysine, histidine, and arginine) is described by the following equations (1)(2)(3) where (4)(5)(6) are the thermodynamic dissociation constants. In these equations the ai\u2019s are activities [mol\u00b7L\u22121]; the \u03b3i\u2019s are activity coefficients; and the terms in brackets are molarities [mol\u00b7L\u22121]. The activity coefficients can be related to ionic strength using a suitable activity coefficient model for electrolytes. The Davies equation (20) was used in this work (7) where A, the Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel constant, incorporates temperature effects, b = 0.1, and zi is the ion charge. A is approximately 0.51 at 298 K or, more precisely, 0.5091 at 298.15 K according to Fernandez et al. (21) The ionic strength is defined as (8) where mk is the molality [mol\u00b7kg\u22121] of ion k. A can be estimated from (22)(9) where \u03c1W and \u03f5 are the density [g\u00b7cm\u22123] and dielectric constant of water, respectively. The latter is expressed as a function of temperature by the equation (23)(10) while \u03c1W is readily available in standard handbooks. We also compared predictions based on this equation with those from the NIST database (24) and found that the results were in nearly perfect agreement (maximum deviation < \u00b1 0.1 %) over the range of temperatures of interest in this work.It should be noted that other models that are thought to be more accurate at higher ionic strengths exist, notably the Pitzer ion interaction model. (25, 26) The latter takes into account ion association effects but requires experimental data specific to the types of ions in solution to determine the ion interaction parameters (27) which are not available for our case. The Davies equation is generally believed to be accurate up to I = 0.5 mol\u00b7kg\u22121. (27) Nonetheless, even at higher ionic strengths, the accuracy of the Davies model is reasonable. For example, comparing predictions based on eqs 7 to 10 with the mean activity coefficient data and fitted values based on the Pitzer model reported by Samson et al. (28) and, more recently, by Moggia and Bianco (27) for various electrolyte solutions shows that the error of eq 7 on log \u03b3 is less than 10 % at ionic strengths as high 1.5 mol\u00b7kg\u22121. Moreover, as shown later in this paper, the Davies model predicts the trends observed in our work within the apparent experimental accuracy of our pK value determinations.Combining eqs 4 to 7 yields: (11)(12)(13) or, alternatively (14)(15)(16) where we assumed that the activity coefficient of the zwitterion is unity. A similar treatment for glutamic acid and tyrosine yields (17)(18)(19)Finally, for the neutral amino acids (phenylalanie, tryptophan, and threonine) we have (20)(21) Since the ionic strength is known at each point along the potentiometric titration curve, in each case we can calculate the thermodynamic values pKi from the apparent values pKi,app using these equations.The temperature dependence of the dissociation constants can be described with the Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation (22) where  is the Gibbs free energy change; \u0394HT,i0 is the standard enthalpy change of reaction; R is the gas constant; and T is temperature. If \u0394HT,i0 is constant, we obtain the van\u2019t Hoff equation (23) or (24) where qi is a dimensionless integration constant.It should be noted that in addition to the treatment discussed above, a general theoretical framework for the prediction of the effects of temperature on thermodynamic constants for aqueous solutions of organic species, including amino acid dissociation constants, has been presented by Shock and Helgeson. (29) While the simplified treatment discussed above does not permit the level of generalization afforded by the model of Shock and Helgeson, it will be shown to be adequate for the correlation of our experimental data.ResultsARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsConclusionsAuthor InformationReferencesThe experimentally determined pKi,app values obtained at different temperatures and ionic strengths are summarized in Tables1 to 8. The ionic strength was calculated from eq 8 based on the solution composition at each half-equivalence point. In this calculation, we took into account the volume and concentration of titrant added, the measured density of the solution, and the concentration of all positively and negatively charged amino acid species calculated using the pKapp values and the total amino acid concentration. Representative trend plots illustrating the effects of ionic strength are shown in Figures1 to 3 for lysine and in Figures4 to 6 for histidine. These plots also show curves calculated according to eqs 14 to 16. For these calculations, the pKi values were determined in each case by a nonlinear least-squares fit of the pKi,app data, minimizing the sum or residual squares between apparent and calculated values. The corresponding values are summarized in Tables 9 and 10 at different temperatures. As seen in Figures 1 to 6, the Davies equation provides a good fit of the experimental results. As seen, for example, for lysine in Figures 1 to 3, pK1,app increases with I, pK3,app decreases with I, and pK2,app remains essentially constant, consistent with eqs 14  to 16. Analogous results were obtained for the other amino acids considered in this work.Table 1.

The fitted parameters, \u0394HT,i0/R and qi, are also summarized in Tables9 and 10. With reference to Figure 7, it can be seen that pK1, corresponding to the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group attached to the \u03b1 carbon, is nearly independent of temperature in most cases, with \u0394HT,i0/R varying between (\u2212285 and 40) K. An exception is arginine for which pK1 decreases significantly with temperature. Even for arginine, however, \u0394HT,i0/R has a relatively low value (1360 K). This general trend is consistent with prior work. For example, Martel and Smith (8) and Borst et al. (18) have both reported \u0394HT,i0/R \u223c 0 for the pK1 of phenylalanine on overlapping temperature ranges. The reasons why the pK1 of arginine exhibits a more pronounced temperature dependence are not known. However, it is possible that this behavior is caused by the much more basic side chain in this amino acid.Figure 7Figure 7. pK1 values of lysine, histidine, arginine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and threonine extrapolated to zero ionic strength at 283.1 K, 298.1 K, 313.1 K, and 333.1 K.

In the case of glutamic acid, the pK2 is for the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group in the side chain. Although its pK value is obviously larger than for the carboxylic acid group attached to the \u03b1 carbon, its dependence on temperature is only marginally larger (\u0394HT,i0/R = \u2212342 K). In the case of histidine, the pK2 is for the deprotonation of the imidazole group in the side chain. This dissociation is more sensitive to temperature with an intermediate value \u0394HT,i0/R = 2729 K. Finally, for the remaining amino acids the pK2 is for the deprotonation of the primary amine group attached to the \u03b1 carbon. These values are much more strongly dependent on temperature with \u0394HT,i0/R values between (3380 and 5155) K.The effect of temperature on the pK3 is shown in Figure 9. For lysine and arginine, pK3 is for the dissociation of the basic amine group on the side chain. These values decrease with temperature with \u0394HT,i0/R values of (5226 and 1604) K, respectively. For histidine and glutamic acid, the pK3 is for the dissociation of the primary amine group on the \u03b1 carbon. Its behavior is consistent with that of the other amino acids decreasing with temperature with \u0394HT,i0/R values of (4510 and 2789) K, respectively. Finally, for tyrosine, pK3 is for the deprotonation of the aromatic hydroxyl group on the side chain. This value decreases somewhat more dramatically with temperature with \u0394HT,i0/R = 5713 K.ConclusionsARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsConclusionsAuthor InformationReferencesThe dissociation constants of amino acids vary with ionic strength, temperature, and the nature of the side chain. The effect of ionic strength at a given temperature is predictable with reasonable accuracy using the Davies equation for the charged amino acid species. The effect of temperature on the pK value extrapolated to zero ionic strength is very small for arginine and practically insignificant for the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group attached to the \u03b1 carbon and only marginally more significant for the dissociation of the carboxylic acid group attached to the side chain of glutamic acid. More pronounced effects are seen to the pK value extrapolated to zero ionic strength for the dissociation of the primary amine attached to the \u03b1 carbon for the basic side chains of lysine and arginine and for the aromatic hydroxyl group of tyrosine. Finally, the temperature dependence of the pK value extrapolated to zero ionic strength for histidine is intermediate. A molecularly based explanation of these effects is outside the scope of this experimental investigation. Nevertheless, the data provided in this paper provide the means of performing speciation calculations for amino acids in solution useful for the design of unit operations for the separation and purification of these molecules. In conclusion, it should be noted that the isoelectric point (pI) of the amino acids also changes with temperature as a result of the different effects of temperature on the various pK\u2019s.Author InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsConclusionsAuthor InformationReferencesCorresponding AuthorHidetada Nagai - Isolation and Purification Technology Laboratory, Fermentation and Biotechnology Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., 1-1 Suzuki-Cho, Kawasaki-Ku, Kawasaki-Shi, 210-8681 Japan, and Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, 102 Engineers\u2019 Way, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904-4741;\u00a0\n    \n                Email: hidetada_nagai@ajinomoto.comAuthorsKo Kuwabara - Isolation and Purification Technology Laboratory, Fermentation and Biotechnology Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., 1-1 Suzuki-Cho, Kawasaki-Ku, Kawasaki-Shi, 210-8681 Japan, and Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, 102 Engineers\u2019 Way, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904-4741Giorgio Carta - Isolation and Purification Technology Laboratory, Fermentation and Biotechnology Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., 1-1 Suzuki-Cho, Kawasaki-Ku, Kawasaki-Shi, 210-8681 Japan, and Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, 102 Engineers\u2019 Way, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904-4741FundingThis research was supported by Ajinomoto Co., Inc.ReferencesARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsConclusionsAuthor InformationReferences\n            This article references 29 other publications.\n        1Hermann, T.

In the 1950s Corynebacterium glutamicum was found to be a very efficient producer of L-glutamic acid.  Since this time biotechnol. processes with bacteria of the species Corynebacterium developed to be among the most important in terms of tonnage and economical value. L-Glutamic acid and L-lysine are bulk products nowadays. L-Valine, L-isoleucine, L-threonine, L-aspartic acid and L-alanine are among other amino acids produced by Corynebacteria.  Applications range from feed to food and pharmaceutical products.  The growing market for amino acids produced with Corynebacteria led to significant improvements in bioprocess and downstream technol. as well as in mol. biol.  During the last decade big efforts were made to increase the productivity and to decrease the prodn. costs.  This review gives an overview of the world market for amino acids produced by Corynebacteria.  Significant improvements in bioprocess technol., i.e. repeated fed batch or continuous prodn. are summarized.  Bioprocess technol. itself was improved furthermore by application of more sophisticated feeding and automatization strategies.  Even though several amino acids developed towards commodities in the last decade, side aspects of the prodn. process like sterility or detection of contaminants still have increasing relevance.  Finally one focus of this review is on recent developments in downstream technol. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXmslens7Y%253D&md5=ea157caa69ff6aad22fb6ec939a530152Saunders, M.

In a pH range from 2 to 7, neutral and acidic amino acids undergo monovalent cation exchange.  The amino acid in the form of \u03b1-NH3+/\u03b1-COOH has a high cation exchange affinity, whereas the \u03b1-NH3+/\u03b1-COO- form has a negligible affinity.  At a pH near the pKa of \u03b1-COOH, both forms coexist; the av. affinity changes significantly as pH approaches the pKa of \u03b1-COOH.  Basic amino acids have two potential cation exchange sites, \u03b1-NH3+ and R(side chain)-NH3+.  The \u03b1-NH3+/\u03b1-COOH form binds at both sites, whereas the \u03b1-NH3+/\u03b1-COO- form binds only at the R-NH3+.  As a result, the av. valence of a basic amino acid can be a fractional no. in the pH range from 2 to 7.  As pH increases, the av. valence decreases from 2 at low pH (<pKa\u03b1) to unity at high pH (>pKa\u03b1).  At a given pH, the av. valence and av. sepn. factor of a basic amino acid against Na+ can change with amino acid concn., Na+ concn., total concn., and exchanger capacity.  A theory which accounts for the heterogeneous charge structures and multiple equil. has been developed to explain the fundamental ion exchange behavior.  The theory correctly predicts how pH, salt concn., and compn. affect the av. valence and the av. sepn. factor.  The results on basic amino acids can explain why peptides and proteins exhibit fractional valences and their av. affinities change with pH, salt concn., and soln. compn.  Our results also indicate that an opposite charge within 5 \u00c5 from an ion exchange site of a biochem. can prevent its electrostatic interaction with an ion exchanger. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK3cXosFSjtw%253D%253D&md5=06c398eb3d44022580376c8ef447934b4Helfferich, F.

Av. ion exchange selectivity coeffs. of 5.0 and 0.75 g/cm3 are obtained for the ion exchange of divalent and monovalent cationic lysine with hydrogen ion, resp., while values of 1.5 and 1.9 are obtained for the exchange of NH4+ and K with hydrogen ion.  A model based on these binary ion exchange measurements and accounting for the soln. equil. is then developed to predict lysine adsorption over a broad range of conditions.  Similarly, resin phase diffusivities are detd. by fitting batch binary ion-exchange data with a mass transfer model based on the Nernst-Planck equations.  Diffusivities of divalent cationic lysine, monovalent cationic lysine, NH4+ ion, and K ion are 0.05 \u00d7 10-6, 0.20 \u00d7 10-6, 1.6 \u00d7 10-6 and 1.9 \u00d7 10-6 cm2/s, resp.  Finally, a general rate model incorporating ion exchange and soln. equil. is developed to predict batch adsorption and desorption of lysine using these diffusivity values over a broad range of conditions. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2cXhtVeku7fN&md5=94e604226bdcd3a82ceeb60bb7bf29047Kirwan, D.

The equil. uptake is found to be relatively insensitive to temp., particularly at high amino acid loadings on the resin.  However, mass transfer rates for conditions where the intraparticle resistance is dominant are found to increase substantially as temp. is increased, with the effect being more pronounced for resins of higher degree of crosslinking.  Intraparticle diffusivities are obtained from alk. desorption expts., while external film mass transfer coeffs. in an agitated contactor are obtained from the rates of amino acid uptake from a dil. soln.

In the 1950s Corynebacterium glutamicum was found to be a very efficient producer of L-glutamic acid.  Since this time biotechnol. processes with bacteria of the species Corynebacterium developed to be among the most important in terms of tonnage and economical value. L-Glutamic acid and L-lysine are bulk products nowadays. L-Valine, L-isoleucine, L-threonine, L-aspartic acid and L-alanine are among other amino acids produced by Corynebacteria.  Applications range from feed to food and pharmaceutical products.  The growing market for amino acids produced with Corynebacteria led to significant improvements in bioprocess and downstream technol. as well as in mol. biol.  During the last decade big efforts were made to increase the productivity and to decrease the prodn. costs.  This review gives an overview of the world market for amino acids produced by Corynebacteria.  Significant improvements in bioprocess technol., i.e. repeated fed batch or continuous prodn. are summarized.  Bioprocess technol. itself was improved furthermore by application of more sophisticated feeding and automatization strategies.  Even though several amino acids developed towards commodities in the last decade, side aspects of the prodn. process like sterility or detection of contaminants still have increasing relevance.  Finally one focus of this review is on recent developments in downstream technol. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXmslens7Y%253D&md5=ea157caa69ff6aad22fb6ec939a530152Saunders, M.

In a pH range from 2 to 7, neutral and acidic amino acids undergo monovalent cation exchange.  The amino acid in the form of \u03b1-NH3+/\u03b1-COOH has a high cation exchange affinity, whereas the \u03b1-NH3+/\u03b1-COO- form has a negligible affinity.  At a pH near the pKa of \u03b1-COOH, both forms coexist; the av. affinity changes significantly as pH approaches the pKa of \u03b1-COOH.  Basic amino acids have two potential cation exchange sites, \u03b1-NH3+ and R(side chain)-NH3+.  The \u03b1-NH3+/\u03b1-COOH form binds at both sites, whereas the \u03b1-NH3+/\u03b1-COO- form binds only at the R-NH3+.  As a result, the av. valence of a basic amino acid can be a fractional no. in the pH range from 2 to 7.  As pH increases, the av. valence decreases from 2 at low pH (<pKa\u03b1) to unity at high pH (>pKa\u03b1).  At a given pH, the av. valence and av. sepn. factor of a basic amino acid against Na+ can change with amino acid concn., Na+ concn., total concn., and exchanger capacity.  A theory which accounts for the heterogeneous charge structures and multiple equil. has been developed to explain the fundamental ion exchange behavior.  The theory correctly predicts how pH, salt concn., and compn. affect the av. valence and the av. sepn. factor.  The results on basic amino acids can explain why peptides and proteins exhibit fractional valences and their av. affinities change with pH, salt concn., and soln. compn.  Our results also indicate that an opposite charge within 5 \u00c5 from an ion exchange site of a biochem. can prevent its electrostatic interaction with an ion exchanger. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK3cXosFSjtw%253D%253D&md5=06c398eb3d44022580376c8ef447934b4Helfferich, F.

Av. ion exchange selectivity coeffs. of 5.0 and 0.75 g/cm3 are obtained for the ion exchange of divalent and monovalent cationic lysine with hydrogen ion, resp., while values of 1.5 and 1.9 are obtained for the exchange of NH4+ and K with hydrogen ion.  A model based on these binary ion exchange measurements and accounting for the soln. equil. is then developed to predict lysine adsorption over a broad range of conditions.  Similarly, resin phase diffusivities are detd. by fitting batch binary ion-exchange data with a mass transfer model based on the Nernst-Planck equations.  Diffusivities of divalent cationic lysine, monovalent cationic lysine, NH4+ ion, and K ion are 0.05 \u00d7 10-6, 0.20 \u00d7 10-6, 1.6 \u00d7 10-6 and 1.9 \u00d7 10-6 cm2/s, resp.

The new adsorbent consists of polymeric beads based on hydrophilic acrylamido and vinyl monomers with a pore structure optimized to allow favorable interactions of IgG with recombinant protein A coupled to the resin. The particles have average diameter of 57\u00a0\u03bcm and a narrow particle size distribution. The IgG adsorption equilibrium capacity is 46\u00a0mg/cm3 and the effective pore diffusivity determined from pulse response experiments for non-binding conditions is 8.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0cm2/s. The IgG adsorption kinetics can be described with the same effective diffusivity by taking into account a heterogeneous binding mechanism with fast binding sites, for which adsorption is completely diffusion controlled, and slow binding sites for which adsorption is controlled by the binding kinetics. As a result of this mechanism, the breakthrough curve exhibits a tailing behavior, which appears to be associated with the slow binding sites. A detailed rate model taking into account intraparticle diffusion and binding kinetics is developed and is found capable of predicting both batch adsorption and breakthrough behavior over an ample range of experimental conditions. The corresponding effective diffusivity is independent of protein concentration in solution over the range 0.2\u20132\u00a0mg/cm3 and of protein binding as a result of the large pore size of the support matrix. Overall, the small particle size and low diffusional hindrance allow capture of IgG with short residence times while attaining substantial dynamic binding capacities.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsIgGProtein AAdsorption equilibriumAdsorption kineticsModelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction of charged dextran polymers results in enhanced adsorption kinetics despite a dramatic reduction of the accessible pore size as determined by inverse size-exclusion chromatography. Incorporation of neutral dextran polymers in a charged agarose bead results instead in substantially lower binding capacities. The effective pore diffusivities obtained from batch uptake curves increase substantially as the protein concentration is reduced for the resins containing charged dextran grafts, but are much less dependent on protein concentration for the resins with no dextran or uncharged dextran grafts. The batch uptake results are corroborated by microscopic observations of transient adsorption in individual particles. In all cases studied, the adsorption kinetics is characterized by a sharp adsorption front consistent with a shell-progressive, diffusion limited mechanism. Greatly enhanced transport rates are obtained with an experimental resin containing charged dextran grafts with effective pore diffusivities that are 1\u20139 times larger than the free solution diffusivity and adsorption capacity approaching 300\u00a0mg/cm3 of particle volume.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProtein adsorptionMass transferIon-exchangeDextran-grafted agaroseRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A local equilibrium model is developed to predict pH transitions using non-adsorbed buffers, i.e. containing neutral and negatively charged buffering species, based exclusively on the resin titration curve. In agreement with experimental results, the model predicts practical, fairly linear gradients between pH 5 and 7, which are formed using suitable mixtures of acetate and phosphate buffers. The separation of mixtures of ovalbumin, albumin, and transferrin is used as a model system, but, unlike most previous work, we consider preparative conditions. Near baseline resolution is obtained with protein loads as high as 10\u00a0mg/mL and mobile phase velocities at high as 460\u00a0cm/h using porous, 70-\u03bcm diameter particles. The peaks obtained with this approach are much sharper than could be obtained isocratically or using externally generated, unretained gradients as a result of the peak compression caused by the axial pH gradient formed along the column. Moreover, separation is obtained at very low ionic strengths (2\u20133\u00a0mS/cm). The effects of flow velocity, mobile phase composition, time of injection, and protein load on retention and elution pH are investigated systematically demonstrating a range of ways in which the separation can be controlled and optimized.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordspH gradient elutionProtein chromatographyIon exchangeLocal equilibrium theoryRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Permanent address: Rzeszow University, Chemical Engineering Department, Al.

The theory predicts the formation of overshoots in the intraparticle concentration profiles and in the total amount adsorbed for the more weakly adsorbed component. An analytical solution valid for the case where the isotherms are rectangular is developed and found to be in good agreement with the limiting behavior of the general numerical solution of the model equations. The experimental results show that the two proteins are competitively adsorbed and that an overshoot of adsorbed cytochrome c occurs during simultaneous adsorption. Model predictions based on the assumption that the adsorption isotherms are rectangular and that lysozyme completely displaces cytochrome c are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental kinetics suggesting that the overshoot phenomena observed with multicomponent systems in these resins can be explained with a diffusion model without the need to account for flux coupling or electrophoretic contributions to transport.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProtein adsorption kineticsIon exchangeMass transfer modelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Present address: Octapharma Inc., Vienna, Austria.View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Size-exclusion and analytical anion-exchange chromatography are used to determine the relative amounts of monomer and dimer for two samples of BSA. While the amount of dimer was generally low, its impact on adsorptive behavior is significant. Equilibrium experiments demonstrate that the anion-exchange media binds the dimer more strongly, leading to an unequal distribution of the monomer and dimer between the two phases. Analysis of the breakthrough behavior of BSA reveals that the monomer breaks through prior to the dimer. This leads to the characteristic tailing breakthrough curve often seen with BSA. Breakthrough experiments carried out using dimer-free BSA confirm that the extreme tailing observed with the commercial samples is curtailed by removing the dimer.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsFrontal analysisHeterogeneityKeywordsBovine serum albuminRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

No selectivity between the different deamidated forms was seen at pH 5 for either stationary phase. However, although the binding strength was lower, both media exhibited substantial selectivity at pH 7.5. The effective binding charge, determined from linear gradient elution experiments and from the steric mass action model, was different for the two different media, but remained nearly the same for the different variants suggesting that the selectivity is determined by the strength of binding, rather than by the binding charge. This result agrees with the higher binding constants determined for the less deamidated forms. At low ionic strength, the binding capacity of the dextran grafted media was much higher than that of the macroporous matrix at either pH. However, similar capacities were obtained for the two stationary phases at \u223c140\u00a0mM Na+ for pH 5 and at 50\u00a0mM Na+ for pH 7.5. For both materials, predictions of multicomponent adsorption based on the steric mass action model were in good agreement with experimental results indicating that the different variants bind in competition with each other. In general, this work demonstrates the utility of modeling adsorption equilibrium allowing an accurate description of competitive binding, which is a necessary step for a complete description of a chromatographic separation process.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMonoclonal antibody charge variantsDeamidationAdsorption isothermIon exchangeSelectivityLinear gradient elutionRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A truly continuous, steady-state separation of mixtures of bovine serum albumin and hemoglobin was obtained with the strong-acid, macroporous resin S-Sepharose. With an appropriate selection of operating conditions, an essentially complete separation was obtained, with a simultaneous concentration of the more strongly retained species, hemoglobin. A model was developed to predict the CAC behaviour step elution conditions. The model predictions, based solely on independently derived values of equilibrium and rate parameters, were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental results, so long as the resolution of different hemoglobin variants did not occur. Except for these conditions, the model provides a useful tool for design and optimization, and a comparison with the experimental results shows that the continuous step elution fractionation of protein mixtures by CAC can be obtained with essentially the same resolution as that of an equivalent conventional chromatograph.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Present address: Chemical Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831, USA.View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1994 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The material investigated possesses a high adsorption capacity at low salt concentration and the bound protein can be recovered quantitatively at high salt concentrations. The effects of salt on adsorption and desorption rates were evaluated from batch and shallow-bed experiments, and a model was developed to describe the data quantitatively. The adsorption capacity decreases as the salt concentration is increased, but both adsorption and desorption rates increase at higher salt concentrations. The predictability of the behavior of columns packed with this material was examined by comparing model predictions and experimental results obtained in laboratory columns. In general, a good agreement was obtained between predicted and experimental breakthrough and elution profiles, especially in shorter columns. Thus, the model allows a prediction of the effects of column length, mobile phase flow-rate, protein feed concentration, and salt concentration on dynamic capacity, productivity, and on the concentration of product fractions.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsSalt effectsIon exchangersPolymeric gelsRetention behaviourDiffusionKeywordsProteinsAcrylamido monomersRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

When using porous particles, resolution and dynamic binding capacity decline rapidly as the flow rate is increased. Monolithic columns have been developed to overcome these limitations. However, there are difficulties in manufacturing homogeneous larger scale monoliths. In this paper we investigate the morphology and performance characteristics of columns based on new ion exchangers obtained by mechanically disrupting continuous beds of acrylamido-based polymeric media. Near colloidal suspensions of loose particles obtained with this procedure can be flow-packed in ordinary chromatography columns resulting in beds of unexpectedly high hydraulic permeability. Columns up to 2.2\u00a0cm in diameter were studied with both Q and S functionalized media. The hydraulic permeability and interparticle porosity of these columns were rather high. The permeabilities of the S and Q media were 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221213 and 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221213\u00a0m2, respectively, while the corresponding porosities were 60 and 70%. These porosity values are similar to those of monoliths, suggesting that these particles assemble under flow to give high-porosity bridged structures. The structure of these packed beds was further characterized by embedding small packed columns in resins and obtaining sections for microscopic observation. The sections reveal the presence of small aggregates of non-porous 1\u20133\u00a0\u03bcm particles, surrounded by flow channels several micrometers in size. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate under isocratic and gradient elution conditions and the dynamic binding capacity were determined for several proteins and were found to be virtually independent of flow.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProtein chromatographyMonolithsPermeabilityIon exchangeRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The immobilized enzyme was effective in catalyzing the synthesis of ethylpropionate, isoamylpropionate, and isoamylbutyrate. With ethanol dissolved in hexane as a substrate, the maximum initial esterification rate was 0.02 mole/(h \u00d7 g of immobilized protein), but the enzyme was stable only when the substrate concentrations were lower than 0.2 m. With isoamyl alcohol in hexane as a substrate, esterification rates as high as 0.085 mole/(h \u00d7 g of immobilized protein) were observed and the immobilized enzyme was stable over a much broader concentration range. However, in this case, the use of a solvent, such as hexane, was not necessary for esterification, and the enzyme could be employed in equimolar acid/alcohol mixtures. A packed-bed reactor was operated successfully for the continuous synthesis of esters. The reactor was stable for long periods of time, and the steady-state performance could be accurately predicted on the basis of batch reaction experiments.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsLipaseimmobilized enzymesesterspacked-bed reactororganic solventsRecommended articlesCited by (0)\u2217The present adress of Mary E.

The study considers two anion-exchangers and a cation-exchanger. Physical properties determined experimentally include particle density, ion-exchange capacity, particle size distribution, and equilibrium isotherms for model proteins. The pore structure was evaluated using size exclusion chromatography with neutral probe molecules and transmission electron microscopy. For the anion-exchangers, two types of structures were inferred. The first is comprised of particles that contain a low-density gel supported by denser polymer aggregates. This material had a very low size-exclusion limit for neutral probes, but exhibited an extremely high and reversible protein adsorption capacity (280\u2013290 mg BSA/ml). The second structure is comprised of particles with large, open macropores. While the size-exclusion limit was very high, the protein adsorption capacity was low (60 mg BSA/ml). Moreover, the adsorption was nearly irreversible. The physical structure of the cation-exchanger appeared to be intermediate between those of the anion-exchangers, containing both large pores and smaller pores yielding an intermediate, but reversible, protein uptake capacity (120\u2013130 mg \u03b1CHY/ml). The different behavior of these materials with regards to protein adsorption correlates well with their physical structure. For these ion-exchangers, high protein adsorption capacities are attained when a low-density polymer gel with a high concentration of functional groups is present.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsIon exchangersAdsorptionPolymeric gelsStationary phases, LCKeywordsProteinsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Markedly different intraparticle concentration profiles are obtained, being very sharp for UNOsphere S, indicating pore diffusion control, but much more diffuse for Capto S, consistent with a solid or surface diffusion mechanism. For single-component adsorption, the mAb effective pore diffusivities for UNOsphere S are approximately De\u00a0=\u00a04.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 and 8.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0cm2/s at pH 5 and 7.5, respectively, while effective solid diffusivities for Capto S are Ds\u00a0=\u00a00.98\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129 and 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0cm2/s at pH 5 and 7.5, respectively. Two-component adsorption at pH 7.5, where the deamidated variants are bound selectively also showed markedly different profiles for the two matrices. UNOsphere S showed distinct adsorption zones within the particles indicating that multicomponent transport occurs with continuous displacement of the more deamidated variant by the less deamidated one. Capto S, however, showed no spatial resolution of the variants within the particle during co-adsorption and very slow mass transfer during sequential adsorption suggesting that protein counter-diffusion is severely hindered in this material.Highlights\u25ba Confocal microscopy provides fundamental insight about the kinetics and mechanism of adsorption of mAb charge variants in cation exchangers. \u25ba Adsorbent architecture has profound influence on rates and mechanisms. \u25ba Microscopic level understanding provides the basis for process modeling and quality by design in mAb capture and separation.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMonoclonal antibody charge variantsIon exchangeMulticomponent adsorption kineticsMass transfer modelingConfocal microscopyRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Microphotography was used to obtain transient protein concentration profiles in these gels using cytochrome c as a probe molecule. Gels based on acrylamido-methylpropane sulfonic acid with 2.5\u201310% N,N\u2032-methylene-bisacrylamide as a cross-linker and with a total polymer concentration of 0.21 g/cm3 yielded diffuse protein concentration profiles which were quantitatively consistent with a Fickian diffusion model. An analytical method was developed to calculate the diffusivity as a function of protein concentration in the gel from the experimental profiles. The diffusivity was found to assume values in the range 2.5\u20135.5\u00b710\u22128 cm2/s and varied somewhat with the protein concentration in the gel. The effects of some of the polymer properties, such as cross-link density, polymer concentration and charge, were also investigated for a limited range of conditions to derive qualitative trends. Results showed that the transport rates increased with a decrease in the cross-link density, were extremely reduced when the polymer concentration was doubled, and were slightly increased when the charge density was decreased by half by polymerizing a 1:1 mixture of acrylamide and acrylamido-methylpropane sulfonic acid monomers.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsDiffusionPolymer gelsKeywordsProteinsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The two-peak behavior is more pronounced for conditions where the initial antibody binding is stronger, i.e. at lower pH and buffer concentration, where the hold time prior to elution is longer, where the protein mass load is lower, and where the load flow rate is higher. The effect is also dependent on the resin type, being prominent for the polymer-functionalized resin Fractogel EMD SO3\u2212 and virtually absent for a macroporous resin with similar backbone but no grafted polymers. Size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering show that the early eluting peak consists exclusively of the native monomeric species while the late eluting peak is a mixture of monomeric and aggregated species. Batch adsorption/desorption experiments show that the bound protein can be desorbed in two steps, with a fraction desorbed in 0.33\u00a0M NaCl, corresponding to native monomer, and a second fraction desorbed in 1\u00a0M NaCl. The latter fraction decreases with protein mass load and becomes almost negligible when the resin is initially completely saturated with protein. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the two-peak elution/desorption behavior is related to the unique kinetics of protein binding in the Fractogel resin. Following partial loading of the resin, the bound protein migrates toward the center of the particles during a hold step and is redistributed across the particle volume attaining low local bound protein concentrations. For these conditions the protein is apparently destabilized forming a strongly-bound unfolded intermediate that, in turn, generates aggregates upon elution in high salt.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMonoclonal antibodyCation exchangeUnfoldingAggregationRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The adsorption kinetics for the macroporous matrix was found to be controlled largely by pore diffusion. The effective diffusivity estimated from single component data was a fraction of the mAb free solution diffusivity, and its value could be used to accurately predict the adsorption kinetics for two- and three-component systems. In this case, when two or more variants were adsorbed simultaneously, both experimental and predicted results showed a temporary overshoot of the amount adsorbed above the equilibrium value for the more deamidated variant followed by a gradual approach to equilibrium. Adsorption rates on the dextran grafted material were much faster than those observed for the macroporous matrix for both single component and simultaneous adsorption cases. In this case, no significant overshoot was observed for the more deamidated forms. The Capto S adsorption kinetics could be described well by a diffusion model with an adsorbed phase driving force for single component adsorption and for the simultaneous adsorption of multiple variants. However, this model failed to predict the adsorption kinetics when more deamidated forms pre-adsorbed on the resin were displaced by less deamidated ones. In this case, the kinetics of the displacement process was much slower indicating that the pre-adsorbed components severely hindered transport of the more strongly bound variants. Overall, the results indicate that despite the lower capacity, the macroporous resin may be more efficient in process applications where displacement of one variant by another takes place as a result of the faster and more predictable kinetics.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMonoclonal antibody charge variantsIon exchangeMulticomponent adsorption kineticsMass transfer modelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Homogeneous gels stabilized against mechanical and osmotic forces were made by synthesizing them inside fused-silica capillaries with a square cross section. Mixtures of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid and acrylamide as the starting co-monomers and N,N\u2018-methylene bisacrylamide as a cross-linker were used in preparing these gels. After polymerization and equilibration of the samples in a buffer, the diffusional transport of cytochrome c was studied via the microscopic determination of the evolution of concentration profiles in the gel upon exposure to a protein solution. Calibrated digitized profiles were used to determine the protein diffusivity in the gel and the effects of boundary-layer mass-transfer resistance on transient adsorption and desorption. The effects of protein and salt concentrations in solution and the effects of the gel composition were determined. The ranges of experimental conditions covered gels with cross-link densities between 2.5 and 10%, total polymer concentrations between 0.05 and 0.42 g/cm3, and charge densities between 97 and 970 \u03bcequiv/cm3. In each case, the concentration profiles observed had a diffuse character and evolved in time in a manner consistent with Fick's law. However, the experimental diffusivity values varied with protein concentration in the gel and were strongly influenced by the composition of the gel and by the salt concentration in solution. * \u2009Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

IntroductionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToPolymeric hydrogels have many current and potential applications in biotechnology as a result of their biocompatibility and ability to selectively allow molecules to enter and diffuse on the basis of size. Whereas neutral hydrogels serve as size-exclusion media, incorporation of a fixed charge, bound to the polymer backbone, introduces the ability to concentrate oppositely charged molecules, including macromolecules such as proteins. These solutes can then be released, for example, by changing the ionic strength or the solution pH, by introducing competitive displacers, or, in some cases, by changing temperature or applying electric fields. 1 Potential applications of charged hydrogels include their use as systems for the delivery of therapeutic agents to tissues and cells, 2,3 as components in transdermal delivery of drugs by electroporation and iontophoresis methods, 4,5 as elements in diagnostic application instruments, 6 and as physical models for in vitro studies of partitioning and transport in tissues. 7 Finally, charged hydrogels have important applications in separations based on chromatography and membrane methods. In general, free-standing charged hydrogels undergo large volume changes in response to solution composition changes. This is a desirable property in certain applications including osmotic devices1 and drug delivery systems controlled by the gel swelling rate, 8 as well as in the use of gels as \u201cgel extraction solvents\u201d. 9 Applications to adsorptive and membrane separations are, however, often hampered by this characteristic. Moreover, homogeneous ionic hydrogels that are sufficiently \u201csoft\u201d to enable macromolecule diffusion are subject to mechanical compression when used in chromatography columns or as membranes. Recently, however, ionic hydrogels that are stabilized against mechanical and osmotic forces by being incorporated into rigid porous structures have been developed. For example, composite particles made by incorporating homogeneous, charged polyacrylamide-based gels within the pores of rigid silica or ceramic particles have been described by Girot and Boschetti 10 and have become commercially available with the trade name HyperD as protein chromatography media. 11,12 In these materials, the rigid backbone of the supporting matrix provides structural integrity, while the gel provides a high adsorptive capacity that allows for efficient chromatographic operations at high flow rates of the mobile phase. 13-15 Membranes obtained by synthesizing ionic hydrogels within the pores of rigid filter media have also been developed. Such composite membranes have been shown to retain the hydraulic permeability of equivalent free-standing gels while being largely unaffected by changes in ionic strength. 16Transport rates are, of course, critical in the aforementioned applications, especially for macromolecules. However, whereas diffusional transport of macromolecules in neutral gels is generally well understood both experimentally and theoretically, 17-20 the literature on diffusion of charged macromolecules in oppositely charged ion-exchange gels is scant. In the case of neutral gels, the partition coefficient is typically less than one, and diffusional transport rates are always lower than in free solution as a result of steric and hydrodynamic hindrances. On the other hand, oppositely charged macromolecules can be very favorably partitioned into ionic hydrogels as a result of electrostatic interactions. 21 Thus, although the mobility or diffusion coefficient of these molecules is low compared to that in free solution,  high transport rates can, in principle, be obtained. This effect is well-known for small ions in ion-exchange resins, 22 but it can also be significant for macromolecules in low-density hydrogels. For example, a number of previous studies of protein adsorption in the gel-composite HyperD media have shown that mass transfer is very rapid and, in some cases, it is faster than could be predicted for ordinary diffusion in the bulk liquid phase.15 This behavior has been described in a semiempirical way using a Fickian diffusion model where the driving force is expressed in terms of the adsorbed protein concentration, implying that the protein molecules retain diffusional mobility within the charged gel. From a macroscopic viewpoint, this modeling approach has been found to be consistent with the experimental behavior, thereby allowing for a prediction of performance under ample ranges of conditions and in both batch and packed column systems.14,15,23 In previous work, we developed a technique for a direct microscopic visualization of protein diffusion in charged polyacrylamide-based gels synthesized within fused-silica capillaries, which can provide greater insight into the nature of protein transport in these gels. 24 For ease of microscopic observation, we use capillaries with a square cross section that eliminates optical artifacts. Optically transparent anionic gels can be synthesized in situ, and colored or fluorescent proteins can be used as probes. The evolution of concentration profiles obtained by exposing the end of the capillary-gel composite to a dilute protein solution can thus be followed by direct observation with a microscope. For these conditions, transport can be observed in an essentially semi-infinite, \u201cflat plate\u201d geometry, which simplifies the mathematical analysis of the experimental profiles. For the case of cytochrome c diffusing in an anionic polyacrylamide gel, we observed diffuse concentration profiles consistent with Fick's law. More complicated profiles were seen under desorption conditions when a protein-loaded gel was exposed to a salt solution, suggesting that complex interactions between counter-diffusing ions take place in these ion exchangers. Analysis of the evolution of concentration profiles can obviously provide a direct measurement of diffusivities and is a powerful means of testing hypothesized transport theories. Thus, the objective of this paper is three-fold. The first objective is to determine the effects of boundary-layer mass transfer at the gel\u2212fluid interface. Because transport in the gel can be rapid, the fluid-phase resistance can become significant at low protein concentrations. Hence, its effect needs to be determined. The second objective is to determine the reversibility of the mass-transfer process under protein binding conditions. In particular, we are interested in exploring what happens when the protein concentration is reduced to zero in the bulk fluid following an initial loading of the gel from a more concentrated protein solution. Finally, the third objective is to determine the protein diffusivity in the gel as a function of polymer concentration, polymer charge density, and salt concentration in solution. For each of these variables, concentration profiles were obtained under transient adsorption or desorption conditions using cytochrome c as the probe. The experimental profiles were analyzed in terms of a model that incorporates the fluid-phase resistance and an empirically determined concentration-dependent diffusivity in the gel. Experimental SectionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToMaterials. The materials used in the preparation of gels were 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS, 98% purity), N,N\u2018-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA, 98% purity), ammonium persulfate (AP), N,N,N,N-tetraethylenediamine (TEMED), and acrylamide. These materials were obtained from Lancaster Synthesis Inc. (Windham, NH) and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Bind-silane (\u03b3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) was obtained from Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ). Cytochrome c from bovine heart (Mr = 13\u2009300, pI = 10.6) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Fused-silica, polyimide-coated capillary tubing with a square cross section was obtained from Polymicro Technologies, Inc. (Phoenix, AZ). This tubing has a nearly perfect square cross section with internal and external widths of 100 and 300 \u03bcm, respectively. The tubing was cut into approximately 1-cm sections, and the polymer coating was burned off from the top 0.5\u22120.6 cm. The sections were then treated with bind-silane as described by Lewus and Carta24 to provide a way of anchoring the polyacrylamide gel by covalent attachment to the capillary. Preparation of Gels. The procedure used to prepare the capillary-constrained gels used in this work is described in detail by Lewus and Carta24 and is similar to the methods described by Girot and Boschetti10 for the preparation of gel-composite particles. Thus, only the main steps are described here. A monomer mixture is first prepared in filtered, degassed water by dissolving the AMPS monomer and the MBA cross-linker in the desired proportion. After the solution is titrated to pH 7 with NaOH, the volume is adjusted to the desired value with additional water. The AP initiator and the TEMED promoter are then added and stirred into the solution. The reaction mixture is then quickly loaded into the capillary sections and allowed to polymerize at room temperature. Upon completion of the polymerization (\u223c1 h), the capillaries are placed into a large volume of 10 mM Na2HPO4 buffer at pH 6.5 for at least 24 h. The composition and basic properties of a \u201cstandard\u201d gel used in this work are summarized in Table 1. Gels with different polymer concentrations were obtained by varying the total concentration of the monomer solution while maintaining the same ratio of AMPS and MBA. Conversely, gels with the same polymer concentration and cross-linking ratio but with different charge densities were obtained by substituting acrylamide for the AMPS monomer in the initial mixture. Microscopic observation of the capillaries after equilibration in the buffer revealed that minimal volume change occurred, as the gel was covalently bound to the ligands at the inner surface of the capillary. The charge density, based on the gel volume, can thus be estimated from the composition of the polymerization mixture. The polymer volume fraction \u03c6 = mpvp/(mpvp + mwvw) was estimated from the initial monomer composition using a value of vp = 0.7 cm3/g for the polymer density, as suggested by Kapur et al. 25 Table 1.\u2009 Composition of Standard Gel Used in This Workpolymer\u2009concentration 0.21 g/cm3cross-link\u2009density 5% g/g charge\u2009density 970 \u03bcequiv/cm3\u03c6 0.15 v/vThe degree of incorporation of the monomers in the gels prepared in this work was estimated by filling  several test tubes with 5 cm3 of a monomer mixture with the composition in Table 1 and allowing the polymerization to proceed. After 1 h, the gel was removed from each test tube, cut into small pieces 1\u22122 mm in size, and placed into a 200 cm3 volume of buffer solution for 48 h to remove any potentially unreacted monomer. The gel particles were recovered by filtration through filter paper; rinsed with distilled, deionized water; and then dried in an oven at 120 \u00b0C for 48 h. The weight of dried polymer was determined and compared with the initial weight of monomer loaded into each test tube. The results gave a 98 \u00b1 0.5% recovery of the initial monomer weight, which is within the monomer purity stated by the supplier. This determination confirms that essentially all of the monomer is incorporated in the gel. Similar results have been obtained by Gelfi and Righetti, 26 who, using a different method, determined that acrylamide\u2212bisacrylamide gels with a 5% cross-link density are fully polymerized within 30 min at room temperature. Measurement of Concentration Profiles. A schematic of the diffusion cell used in this work is shown in Figure 1. The cell was realized by sandwiching a 1/8-in.-thick Teflon slab between two microscope slides as described in detail by Lewus and Carta.24 One end of a capillary tube section prepared as described above was sealed by gluing it to the tip of a syringe needle with a cyanoacrylate adhesive. The needle was then inserted into the cell. The protein solution was allowed to flow in to and out of the cell through stainless steel tubes (1/32-in. o.d., 1/64-in. i.d.) and recirculated with a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Chicago, IL) at a flow rate of 0.5 cm3/min. Two flow configurations were used, as shown in Figure 1. In the parallel-flow configuration, the solution flow is perpendicular to the capillary. In this case, the velocity past the tip of the capillary has the same magnitude as the mean velocity in the flow channel, or about 0.033 cm/s (120 cm/h) for our experimental conditions. This velocity is comparable to values typically used in packed columns for preparative protein chromatography. In the impinging-flow configuration, the inlet tube is positioned at a distance of approximately 3 mm from the tip of the capillary. Thus, in this case, the approach velocity is similar to the mean velocity in the feed tubing, or about 7.8 cm/s (28\u2009000 cm/h) for our experimental conditions. The vastly different velocities obtained in the two configurations should result in highly different boundary-layer mass-transfer-resistance effects.  Figure 1 Schematic of cells used for diffusion studies.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe evolution of concentration profiles in the gel was followed by direct observation with a microscope, as described by Lewus and Carta.24 Cytochrome c is intensely colored (reddish-brown) and is favorably partitioned in these gels at low ionic strength. 27 Thus, diffusional transport in the gel can be characterized by direct visual observation. Gray-scale values of the digitized images were obtained using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) and were converted to protein concentrations in the gel using a calibration curve obtained by determining the gray scale for identical capillaries filled with cytochrome c solutions of different concentrations.24The equilibrium binding capacity of the gels for cytochrome c was also determined. To obtain these data, capillary tubes prepared as discussed above were suspended in cytochrome c solutions of known concentrations. After 72 h, the capillaries were placed into the flow cell, and images were recorded. The gray-scale level of the saturated gel was then used to determine the equilibrium binding capacity. At low protein concentrations, however, external mass transfer under stagnant conditions was so slow that equilibrium was not established even after 72 h. Thus, at protein concentrations of 0.1 and 0.25 mg/cm3, the capacity was determined by allowing the tubes to come to equilibrium under flow conditions in the diffusion cell. The equilibrium binding capacity was also determined through a direct measurement by equilibrating several capillary tubes in a 1 mg/cm3 cytochrome c solution and then eluting the protein by immersing the tubes in a known volume of a 500 mM buffered NaCl solution. For these conditions, the protein was completely desorbed. Hence, the amount of protein initially bound could be calculated from a material balance based on the analytical determination of the concentration of the desorbed protein in the salt buffer. The latter was done by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm with a spectrophotometer (Beckman, model DU50). All experiments were conducted at room temperature, 23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, in a 10 mM Na2HPO4 buffer at pH 6.5. ResultsARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToProtein Adsorption Equilibrium. The protein binding isotherm for the standard gel having the composition given in Table 1 is shown in Figure 2. The maximum capacity is in excess of 400 mg/cm3, which is in agreement with the value of 410 \u00b1 80 mg/cm3 obtained independently by measuring the amount of protein desorbed, as discussed in the Experimental Section. This value is consistent with the high protein binding capacity values observed for commercial HyperD particles27 and is a result of the high charge density of the gel and the apparent accessibility of the charged groups. Assuming a value of 0.7 cm3/g for the specific volume of the protein, 28 the measured protein binding capacity corresponds to a volume fraction of protein in the gel of 0.29 \u00b1 0.06, indicating that protein  binding must occur through a three-dimensional filling of the polymer gel network. The isotherm data were empirically represented by the Toth isotherm, which has the form where q* and C are the adsorbed and fluid-phase equilibrium protein concentrations, respectively; and qm, b, and n are fitting parameters. The parameter values determined from a nonlinear least-squares fit of the data are qm = 450 mg/cm3, b = 7.7 cm3/mg, and n = 1.3. The calculated isotherm line is shown in Figure 2. Binding capacities at different salt concentrations were also determined, but only at a cytochrome c concentration of 1 mg/cm3. These results are presented later.  Figure 2 Equilibrium isotherm for cytochrome c adsorption in standard gel.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideExperimental Determination of Concentration Profiles. Digitized images of the evolution of the cytochrome c concentration profiles during adsorption in a gel with the composition described in Table 1 under impinging flow conditions are shown in Figure 3, along with calibrated profiles normalized with respect to the equilibrium capacity, q*. Approximately 1 mm of capillary tube is visible in these images. The lightly colored area surrounding the capillary corresponds to the 1 mg/cm3 cytochrome c solution used in this experiment. The dark red band seen progressing toward the left corresponds to the cytochrome c penetration into the gel. The favorable partioning of cytochrome c in the gel for these conditions is evident from the large contrast in red intensity between the solution and gel phases. Some imperfections clearly exist near the cut end of the capillary, and the gel is seen to protrude slightly beyond the boundaries of the fused-silica tube. However, because the times of the observations were quite long and the depth of penetration of cytochrome c was substantial, these imperfections at the boundary should be of limited significance in the interpretation of the results. Concentration gradients in the direction transverse to the capillary also appear to be absent. From gray-scale analysis of the digitized images, variations in this direction were very small (<5%), except in the region immediately adjacent to the walls where shadowing prevented an accurate determination of the concentration. These regions, amounting to less than 10% of the total width, were, of course, not used to calculate the axial concentration profiles. Both the digitized images and the calibrated profiles show that the cytochrome c band in the gel has a smooth, diffuse nature, with the concentration in the gel gradually declining from a maximum at the exposed tip of the capillary to zero toward the unexposed end.  Figure 3 Digitized images and calibrated concentration profiles for cytochrome c adsorption with impinging flow. Protein concentration = 1 mg/cm3, standard gel. Profiles are shown at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideMathematical Analysis of Concentration Profiles. A mathematical analysis based on a Fickian diffusion model with a concentration-dependent diffusivity Ds(q) was used to treat the experimental concentration profiles. No assumption regarding the form of the Ds(q) function was made, as it can be determined directly from the experimental profiles, as follows. Initially neglecting the fluid-phase resistance, the conservation equation and boundary conditions for uniaxial diffusion into a semi-infinite slab can be written as where q0 and qs are, respectively, the initial and interfacial protein concentrations in the gel. The latter is given by the adsorption isotherm. Inspection of the experimental profiles shown in Figure 3 confirms that these boundary conditions are compatible with the experimental system. This occurs because, for these conditions, equilibrium is achieved rapidly (compared to the time scale of the experiment) at the exposed tip of the capillary and the concentration profile is not allowed to extend to the opposite end. It should be noted that eq 2 assumes a diffusional driving force written in terms of the adsorbed-phase protein concentration gradient. Applying the Boltzmann transformation to eq 2 yields the ordinary differential equation where Finally, integrating eq 3 from \u03b7 = \u221e to \u03b7 yields which can be used to calculate the diffusivity as a function of concentration directly from the experimental profiles. As an example, Figure 4a shows the data of Figure 3 plotted as a function of \u03b7 for times of 0.5\u22124 h. The region near the exposed tip of the capillary, where some artifacts exist, is omitted from this graph and was not used in these calculations. The collapse of the profiles for different times onto essentially a single curve supports the validity of the approach. To perform the integral and derivative calculations needed for eq 5, the experimental profiles at each time in the form of \u03b7 vs q were fitted with a smooth function. Integral and derivative terms were then computed analytically. Typical results are shown in Figure 4b. For this case, the experimental diffusivity remains fairly constant as a function of protein concentration in the gel and has an average value of 4 \u00d7 10-8 cm2/s. Although the diffusivity value is many times smaller than the diffusivity of cytochrome c in solution (D0 = 1 \u00d7 10-6 cm2/s), the rate of mass transfer was actually very high. In fact, for these conditions, because the isotherm is very favorable, an equivalent diffusivity D\u0303 based on a driving force expressed as a gradient in fluid-phase concentration can be calculated as15 The resulting value is approximately 16 times higher than the free solution diffusivity, indicating that protein transport through this gel occurs at a much higher rate than could be expected for fluid-phase diffusion alone.  Figure 4 (a) Concentration profiles plotted vs \u03b7. (b) Calculated diffusivity for cytochrome c adsorption. Conditions as in Figure 3. High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideEffects of Boundary-Layer Resistance. The preceding analysis of concentration profiles was based on the assumption that equilibrium is established rapidly at the exposed end of the gel. Mass transfer to the surface of the gel can be expected to be high because of the high velocity flow of the protein solution past the capillary tube in the impinging-flow configuration. However, because, as discussed above, transport in the gel is fast, under certain conditions, the external film could still offer a limiting resistance. A qualitative criterion for determination of the importance of the external resistance during adsorption can be based on the magnitude of the dimensionless group where \u03bb is the mean depth of penetration of the protein profile in the gel and kf is the boundary-layer mass-transfer coefficient. The external resistance is dominant when \u03b4 is less than 1. This occurs for short times (\u03bb \u2192 0) and for large values of the partition ratio q*/C, i.e., for low protein solution concentrations. Moreover, because kf increases with fluid velocity, the external resistance is likely to be more important in the parallel-flow configuration. Concentration profiles obtained for the adsorption of cytochrome c in the parallel-flow configuration of the diffusion cell at 1 and 0.25 mg/cm3 are shown in Figure 5. At 1 mg/cm3 protein concentration, the profiles appear to extrapolate fairly well to the same interfacial value of q/q* = 1, indicating that, for these conditions, the external resistance plays only a small role. However, this is not the case at 0.25 mg/cm3 protein concentration. In this case, the profiles extrapolate to q/q* = 1 only at long times. As shown in Figure 6, the same behavior at the interface is also observed for the impinging-flow configuration but at the substantially lower protein solution concentration of 0.1 mg/cm3.  Figure 5 Effect of protein concentration on concentration profiles for cytochrome c adsorption with parallel flow. (a) Protein concentration = 1 mg/cm3, profiles shown at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h.

Profiles shown at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideEstimates of the values of the mass-transfer coefficient, kf, were obtained from a comparison of the model, modified to account for the external resistance, with experiments at low protein concentration. In this case, boundary condition 2a in the model equation is replaced by where C and Cs are the protein solution concentrations in the bulk and at the surface of the gel, respectively. The empirical Toth isotherm was used to relate Cs and qs. Numerically computed profiles obtained from the solution of eq 2 with eqs 7, 2b, and 2c as boundary conditions and using the experimental dependence of Dsobtained from the impinging-flow experiment at a protein concentration of 1 mg/cm3 were compared with the experimental profiles in Figures 5b and 6 for different values of kf. The solution was obtained by finite differences, as described in Lewus. 29 Best-fit values were kf = (2.0 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10-3 cm/s for parallel flow and kf = (9 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10-3 cm/s for impinging flow. As expected, the latter value is substantially higher as the boundary-layer thickness is likely to be much smaller in impinging  flow. 30 The corresponding Sherwood number values, based on the width of the gel capillaries, are Sh = 20 and Sh = 90 for parallel and impinging flow, respectively. Calculated profiles using the best-fit kf values are shown in Figures 3, 5, and 6. In all cases, the calculated profiles are within the accuracy of the experimental determinations. It is noteworthy that the fitted kf values predict the correct trend with respect to protein solution concentration. In fact, in agreement with the experimental trends, the effect of kf is very small at 1 mg/cm3 in parallel flow (Figure 5a) and insignificant at 1 mg/cm3 in impinging flow (Figure 3). The second case considered for comparison with predicted profiles involves a situation in which the gel is exposed to protein-free buffer after having been exposed to 1 mg/cm3 cytochrome c for 4 h. In this case, because the isotherm is favorable, desorption of protein from the gel is expected to be limited largely by the external mass-transfer resistance. This occurs because the protein concentration in the fluid phase adjacent to the exposed end of the gel is kept very low by the favorable nature of the isotherm. As a result, the driving force for external transport is low, and the effect of kf should be dominant. Experimental and predicted profiles are shown in Figure 7 for a gel with the composition described in Table 1. During the first 0.5 h after the protein concentration is decreased to zero in solution, the protein concentration in the gel near the tip of the capillary is reduced by more than 20%. However, the protein clearly continues to diffuse into the gel. As time progresses, the protein moves further into the gel, while the concentration at the tip decreases slowly. It is apparent that a small amount of protein is desorbed from the gel, which explains the maximum in the profiles. The predicted profiles, obtained using eqs 2, 7, 2b, and 2c with kf = 2 \u00d7 10-3 cm/s, slightly overestimate the rate, indicating that the protein might experience a small additional resistance to transport as it \u201cdetaches\u201d from the gel. However, in general, the model predicts the experimental trends accurately without adjustment of any of the parameter values.

It is well-established that polymer properties can strongly affect diffusion and partitioning of proteins in neutral gels (e.g., refs 20 and 31\u221233). Studies on the effects of polymer properties for protein diffusion in ionic gels, however, have been rather limited. Here, we consider the effects of the cross-link density, the polymer concentration, and the charge density of the gel on cytochrome c diffusion and partitioning. Effect of Cross-Link Density. The effect of cross-link density on cytochrome c transport was considered previously by Lewus and Carta24 for capillary-constrained gels with the composition of Table 1, who varied the degree of cross-linking from 2.5 to 10% while maintaining a constant total polymer concentration in the monomer mixture. A 30% increase in the cytochrome c diffusivity was obtained when the extent of cross-linking was reduced from 10 to 5%. However, further reduction of the degree of cross-linking to 2.5% had a  smaller effect. This behavior is quite different from that expected for a free-standing gel where the polymer concentration is inversely related to the cross-link density. In our case, because the gel is synthesized in situ in a confined volume, the polymer concentration remains essentially constant for different cross-link densities. This is consistent with the observations of Kapur et al.16 for gels supported in porous membranes. A summary of our data on the effects of the cross-link density is given in Figure 8a. To facilitate a comparison of different gels, we define a limiting diffusivity, Ds*, obtained by extrapolating the Ds(q) data to q = q*. The latter is shown, along with the partition ratio, K = q*/C. In addition, to provide a comparison of the overall rate of adsorption, we also calculated the total amount of protein adsorbed in a 4-h period, and this is shown in Figure 8b. As seen in these figures, although the partitioning of the protein in the gel increases slightly as the degree of cross-linking is increased, the diffusivity is reduced more substantially. As a result, the amount of protein adsorbed declines slightly.  Figure 8 Effect of cross-link density. (a) Diffusivity and partition ratio. (b) Total protein adsorbed in 4 h. Protein concentration = 1 mg/cm3.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideEffect of Polymer Concentration. The polymer concentration was varied by altering the amount of monomer and cross-linker present in the gel while maintaining their ratio constant. Five different polymer concentrations were tested:\u2009 0.05, 0.11, 0.21, 0.32, and 0.42 g/cm3. At a polymer concentration of 0.42 g/cm3, very little penetration of cytochrome c in the gel could be detected.24 However, different results were obtained at the other concentrations considered in this work. Concentration profiles for a polymer concentration of 0.11 g/cm3 are shown in Figure 9, along with the diffusivities as a function of adsorbed cytochrome c concentration for the range 0.05\u22120.32 g/cm3. Ds in each case varies with the adsorbed-phase concentration. On average, however, the diffusivity has the highest values at 0.11 g/cm3 and is lower at both higher and lower polymer concentrations. Calculated profiles using the fitted Ds(q) data are shown in Figure 9 and are in good agreement with the experimental profiles. Figure 10 shows a summary of the effects of polymer concentration on partitioning and transport. In this case, both the diffusivity and the partition ratio have a maximum at intermediate polymer concentrations. This is also true for the amount of protein adsorbed in 4 h, which combines the effects of Ds and K. For these conditions, the adsorption rate appears to have a maximum at a protein concentration of around 0.1 g/cm3.

Protein concentration = 1 mg/cm3.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideIt is of interest to compare the results obtained for cytochrome c in our charged gels with the partition coefficient, KD, for a neutral spherical molecule of the same size as this protein. Obviously, in the absence of attractive interactions between this molecule and the gel, KD is less than 1 because of size-exclusion effects. Assuming that the polymer gel can be represented as a matrix of long cylindrical fibers of radius rf, KD can be estimated from the expression17,33 where rs is the molecule radius. For cytochrome c, rs is estimated to be 2.1 nm from diffusion data. For polyacrylamide gels, values of rf between 0.325 and 0.65 nm have been suggested. 33-36 Although these values can  only be used as rough approximations for our AMPS-based gels, they still provide useful insight. Table 2 shows the calculated values of \u03c6 and KD for our constrained gels with different polymer concentrations using the estimate of rf = 0.65 nm, along with the measured partition ratio, K, for cytochrome c. It is apparent that, for a polymer concentration of 0.42 g/cm3, nearly complete exclusion of an equivalently sized neutral molecule is obtained. As the polymer concentration is reduced, the mesh size becomes sufficiently large to permit favorable partitioning and rapid diffusion. However, as the polymer concentration is reduced further, the charge density decreases to the point where partitioning becomes much less favorable and a much smaller partition ratio is attained. We can conclude that the size-exclusion effects of the polymer gel can be overcome by the attractive interaction between the protein and the charged groups, but only up to a point where size exclusion becomes dominant. For example, a gel with the standard composition of Table 1, although effective in adsorbing cytochrome c, would become ineffective for a larger protein. This was verified experimentally using hemoglobin. This protein has an effective radius rs \u2248 3.5 nm, which gives a corresponding value of KD = 0.002. Very little adsorption of this protein was observed for this gel.29 Table 2.\u2009 Estimated and Experimental Gel Properties for Different Polymer Concentrationspolymer concentration (g/cm3)charge density (\u03bcequiv/cm3)\u03c6\u2009 (v/v)KDaKb0.05 230 0.035 0.53 120 0.11 508 0.075 0.26 410 0.21 970 0.15 0.068 420 0.32 1480 0.23 0.016 320 0.42 1940 0.30 0.004 200a\u2009Partition coefficient calculated from eq 8 with rs = 2.1 nm.b\u2009Experimental partition ratio for cytochrome c with C = 1 mg/cm3.Effect of Charge Density. The gel charge density was changed by adding varying amounts of neutral acrylamide monomer in place of AMPS while keeping the cross-link density and the total polymer concentration constant at the values given in Table 1. Figure 11 shows the concentration profiles obtained with a charge density of 97 \u03bcequiv/cm3 and the calculated Ds values vs q/q*. Figure 12 gives the limiting diffusivity Ds*, the partition ratio, and the amount of protein adsorbed in 4 h. Profiles calculated from the model using the fitted Ds(q) data are also shown in Figure 11a for a comparison with the experimental profiles. As the charge density is reduced, the behavior of Ds as a function of q/q* changes. Instead of decreasing, Ds increases with q/q* at charge densities of less than 485 \u03bcequiv/cm3. Moreover, the average diffusivity increases substantially when the charge density is reduced to 190 \u03bcequiv/cm3. Although the partition ratio is much lower at this lower charge density (q* \u2248 180 mg/cm3), the overall rate of adsorption is still greatest for this case. At a charge density of 97 \u03bcequiv/cm3, the diffusivity remains similar to that at 190 \u03bcequiv/cm3. However, the partition ratio is greatly reduced, leading to a lower rate of adsorption.

In a free-standing ionic gel, this effect can be dramatic, as the gel volume can change substantially as the ionic strength  is varied. However, in our case, gel volume variations were absent. To investigate the effect of salt concentration on diffusion and partitioning, experiments were done with the standard gel with the composition of Table 1 using 1 mg/cm3 cytochrome c solutions containing different concentrations of NaCl. Figure 13 shows the concentration profiles obtained at 50 mM NaCl and the calculated Ds values as a function of q/q*, and Figure 14 shows the dependence of Ds* and K on salt concentration. Curves calculated using the fitted Ds(q) values are also shown in Figure 13. The general trends with regard to the shape of the concentration profiles remain similar as the salt concentration is increased. However, the diffusivity gradually increases, while the partition ratio decreases sharply. This behavior can be explained by the fact that the presence of salt reduces the electrostatic interaction between the protein and the gel's ionogenic groups while increasing the flexibility of the gel through decreased electrostatic repulsion between the polymer chains. The combination of these two effects leads to greater diffusional mobility but also reduces partitioning. The effect on partitioning is much more pronounced than the effect on diffusivity. Thus, the net effect is that the amount adsorbed in 4 h decreases as the salt concentration is increased.

An important consideration is a comparison of the results obtained in this work with those previously obtained for commercial HyperD media where charged hydrogels similar to those used here are supported not by a straight capillary but by the randomly oriented and tortuous pore network of silica particles. Table 3 gives the relevant properties for the anionic S-HyperD particles as determined by Lewus and Carta.27 The effects of the adsorptively inert support matrix in these particles can be taken into account in the classical way by defining \u201ccorrected\u201d properties calculated on a \u201cper gel volume\u201d basis using the support porosity \u03b5p \u2248 0.6 and an assumed tortuosity factor \u03c4p = 4 for the pore network.36 Thus, for example, the corrected charge density of S-HyperD is (200 \u03bcequiv/cm3)/0.6 = 330 \u03bcequiv/cm3, and the corrected diffusivity of cytochrome c is (1 \u00d7 10-8 cm2/s) \u00d7 (4/0.6) \u2248 7 \u00d7 10-8 cm2/s. The properties of a comparable gel synthesized with the same charge density are also given in Table 3. As seen in this table, the gels with the same charge density also have nearly the same protein uptake capacity for cytochrome c and similar average diffusivities. In addition, similar trends have also been observed for S-HyperD particles with respect to the effect of protein concentration on the boundary-layer mass-transfer resistance15,27 and with respect to the effect of salt concentration on diffusion rates in the particles. 37 This suggests that predictions for gels supported in pores of typical support matrixes can be made using the results in this work within the range of accuracy normally expected for the simple classical tortuosity factor approach.

Diffuse concentration profiles that are consistent with a Fickian diffusion model in which the driving force is expressed  in terms of the gradient in adsorbed protein concentration are observed. Because of the rapid rate of protein transport in these gels, boundary-layer mass-transfer limitations become important in our experimental system for certain conditions. These effects are taken into account in a model developed in this work that predicts transient adsorption at both low and high protein concentrations, as well as desorption, when mass transfer out of the gel becomes nearly completely dominated by the external resistance. The effects of gel composition and ionic strength on partitioning and transport have been determined. The effect of cross-link density over the range 2.5\u221210% is small compared to what could be expected for free-standing gels, because in our constrained gels, the volume remains essentially constant as the cross-link density is varied. The effect of polymer concentration is, however, rather dramatic. As the polymer concentration is increased, the effective mesh size decreases. Thus, although the charge density increases with polymer concentration, as the polymer concentration is gradually increased, a point is reached at which size exclusion becomes dominant and both partitioning and transport are dramatically reduced. A maximum rate is obtained at intermediate polymer concentrations. Increasing charge density while keeping a constant polymer concentration has the effect of increasing partitioning but decreasing diffusivity. As a result, a maximum rate is again observed at intermediate charge densities. Adding NaCl to the protein solution does not change the qualitative trends of the diffusion profiles. However, partitioning of the protein is substantially reduced, while a moderate increase in diffusivity occurs. As a result, adsorption rates are maximized at low ionic strengths. In summary, although a theory to predict the behavior of proteins in oppositely charged ionic gels is not yet available, the data obtained in this work can provide a basis for the design of separation media with optimized properties. Further results for cationic gels and for multicomponent transport situations will be the subject of future communications. Author InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAuthorsRebecca K.

The objective of this paper is to elucidate the mass transport mechanisms in two com. adsorbents, POROS Q/M and Q Hyper D, and to answer the question if intraparticle convection is present as a mass transfer mechanism.  In the first part of the paper, mass transfer inside porous particles is discussed.  The mass transfer mechanism which allows improved performance of perfusion chromatog. is intraparticle convection.  The combined effect of intraparticle convection and diffusion is an \"augmented\" effective diffusivity.  This is the key concept to explain the peak sharpening and modified Van Demeter plots found with large-pore particles.  In the second part, column efficiencies in terms of HETP as a function of bed superficial velocity are exptl. measured for a non-retained protein (bovine serum albumin [BSA]) in two adsorbents: POROS Q/M (PerSeptive Biosystems) and Q Hyper D (BioSepra).  In the third section, breakthrough curves for both materials are measured for a test protein (BSA) from which useful capacities and productivities as a function of flow-rate are calcd.

In this article the various math. models derived to explain and predict solute diffusion in hydrogels are discussed and tested against literature data.  These models can be divided into those applicable to hydrogels composed of flexible polymer chains (i.e., homogeneous hydrogels) and those composed of rigid polymer chains (i.e., heterogeneous hydrogels).  For homogeneous hydrogels it was detd. that a scaling hydrodynamic model provided the best explanation for solute diffusion, while for heterogeneous hydrogels obstruction models were more consistent with the exptl. data.

The measurements were made by fluorescence spectroscopy; fluorescent dyes were covalently attached to the macromols.  The dependence of K on .vphi. for the proteins agrees with a model of the gel network as randomly placed, impenetrable rods.  The diffusion data are interpreted in terms of an effective medium theory for the mobility of a sphere in a Brinkman fluid.

The gel effect on partitioning is significantly greater than that on diffusion.  The permeability (KDgel) of bovine serum albumin decreased by 103 over the range .vphi. = 0\u21928%, and the ratio of permeabilities for RNase compared to BSA increased from 2-30. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28XitVOgt74%253D&md5=26744ec6900d7141a6579f662bb9a5d334Jackson, G.

The objective of this paper is to elucidate the mass transport mechanisms in two com. adsorbents, POROS Q/M and Q Hyper D, and to answer the question if intraparticle convection is present as a mass transfer mechanism.  In the first part of the paper, mass transfer inside porous particles is discussed.  The mass transfer mechanism which allows improved performance of perfusion chromatog. is intraparticle convection.  The combined effect of intraparticle convection and diffusion is an \"augmented\" effective diffusivity.  This is the key concept to explain the peak sharpening and modified Van Demeter plots found with large-pore particles.  In the second part, column efficiencies in terms of HETP as a function of bed superficial velocity are exptl. measured for a non-retained protein (bovine serum albumin [BSA]) in two adsorbents: POROS Q/M (PerSeptive Biosystems) and Q Hyper D (BioSepra).  In the third section, breakthrough curves for both materials are measured for a test protein (BSA) from which useful capacities and productivities as a function of flow-rate are calcd.  Exptl. results indicate that intraparticle convection plays indeed an important role in both adsorbents. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK2MXjsFamtb8%253D&md5=7d25bc0e0a13ef5d1e61ca0323c5372a14Fernandez, M.

Solute behavior in hydrogels has been explained in terms of redn. in hydrogel free vol., enhanced hydrodynamic drag on the solute, increased path length due to obstruction, and a combination of hydrodynamic drag and obstruction effects.  In this article the various math. models derived to explain and predict solute diffusion in hydrogels are discussed and tested against literature data.  These models can be divided into those applicable to hydrogels composed of flexible polymer chains (i.e., homogeneous hydrogels) and those composed of rigid polymer chains (i.e., heterogeneous hydrogels).  For homogeneous hydrogels it was detd. that a scaling hydrodynamic model provided the best explanation for solute diffusion, while for heterogeneous hydrogels obstruction models were more consistent with the exptl. data.  Both the scaling hydrodynamic model and the most appropriate obstruction model contain undefined parameters which must be clarified in order for these models to gain widespread acceptance. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1cXms1Kns74%253D&md5=dc41c3a5a06648497caf7dc2f273133519Boyer, P.

The gel was synthesized in the membranes by impregnating the pores with a soln. of monomer and crosslinker and then initiating polymn. by UV radiation.  The rate of diffusion and convection (ultrafiltration) of two proteins, RNase A (RNAse) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), was measured as a function of the amt. of gel in the pores expressed as the vol. fraction (.vphi.) occupied by the polymer forming the gel network.  The diffusion rate of potassium chloride (KCl) and glucose was also measured to det. the effects of the gel on small mols.  The effective diffusion coeff. (Deff), normalized by the diffusion coeff. in bulk soln. (Do), and the reflection coeff. (.vsigma.) were correlated with the parameter (as/af).vphi. where as is the Stokes-Einstein radius of the solute mol. and af is the radius of the PA chains (6\u00c5) forming the gel network inside the pores.  Both Deff/Do and 1-.vsigma. decreased sharply as (as/af).vphi. approached the value 0.6.  The gel had only a small effect on the diffusion of KCl and glucose.

The gel concn., expressed as a vol. percentage of PA in the gel (.vphi.), varied between 0-14%.  The measurements were made by fluorescence spectroscopy; fluorescent dyes were covalently attached to the macromols.  The dependence of K on .vphi. for the proteins agrees with a model of the gel network as randomly placed, impenetrable rods.  The diffusion data are interpreted in terms of an effective medium theory for the mobility of a sphere in a Brinkman fluid.  Using values of the Brinkman parameter in the literature, the effective medium model with no adjustable parameters fits the diffusion data for the proteins very well but under predicts Dgel for the linear polymers.  The gel effect on partitioning is significantly greater than that on diffusion.  The permeability (KDgel) of bovine serum albumin decreased by 103 over the range .vphi. = 0\u21928%, and the ratio of permeabilities for RNase compared to BSA increased from 2-30. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28XitVOgt74%253D&md5=26744ec6900d7141a6579f662bb9a5d334Jackson, G.

Six stationary phases are considered, including two tentacle-type resins (Fractogel EMD SO3-(M) and Eshmuno S), a resin with grafted polymeric surface extenders (Nuvia S), a resin with a bimodal pore size distribution (POROS HS 50), and two macroporous resins without polymer grafts (Source 30S and UNOsphere Rapid S). The two-peak elution behavior is very pronounced for the tentacle and polymer-grafted resins and for POROS HS 50, but is essentially absent for the two macroporous resins. The extent of this behavior decreases as the buffer pH and concentration increase and, consequently, mAb binding becomes weaker. Replacing sodium with arginine as the buffer counterion, which is expected to decrease the mAb binding strength, nearly completely eliminates the two-peak behavior, while replacing sodium with tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide, which is expected to increase the mAb binding strength, dramatically exacerbate the effect. As shown by hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HX-MS), the two-peak elution behavior is related to conformational changes that occur when the mAb binds. These changes result in increased solvent exposure of specific peptides in the Fc-region for either the Fractogel or the Nuvia resin. No significant conformational changes were seen by HX-MS when the mAb was bound to the UNOsphere resin or on the Fractogel resin when arginine was used in lieu of sodium as the load buffer counterion. Experiments with two additional mAbs on the Fractogel resin show that the two-peak elution behavior is dependent on the particular antibody. Circular dichroism suggests that the propensity of different mAbs to either precipitate directly or to form stabilizing intermolecular structures upon exposure to thermal stress can be related to their chromatographic behaviors.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMonoclonal antibodiesCation exchangeUnfoldingAggregationHydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange mass spectrometryCircular dichroismRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The adsorbent medium, known as S-HyperD, comprises polystyrene-coated silica particles whose pores are filled with a functionalized poly(acrylamide)-based hydrogel. The equilibrium uptake decreases gradually with salt concentration in the range 0\u2212150 mM, and no uptake occurs at concentrations of 300 mM or greater. In the low salt range, the rates are consistent with a homogeneous diffusion model where the driving force is the bound protein concentration gradient. As a result of highly favorable partitioning in the gel, transport rates are higher than predicted for diffusion in liquid-filled pores. At high salt concentrations, the measured rates are still consistent with the model, but the diffusivity is higher. In all cases, intraparticle transport is independent of hydrodynamics. The behavior of cyclic column operations is successfully predicted using this model. * \u2009To whom correspondence should be addressed. Telephone:\u2009 (804) 924 6281. Fax:\u2009 (804) 982 2658.

Operating at high speed often has the advantage of higher productivity and may result in improved product recovery as a result of the shorter processing time. A key issue in the development of such media is to be able to balance matrix properties that lead to high adsorption capacities with those that lead to a mechanical strength sufficient to allow operation with small particle sizes at high flow rates. Functionalized \u201csoft\u201d hydrogels, such as polyacrylamide and dextran, can be designed to exhibit high capacities and may exhibit rapid diffusional kinetics. However they are compressible and swell or shrink in response to ionic strength changes. Conversely, rigid porous media, such as silica and polystyrene\u2212DVB matrixes, while capable of withstanding high compressive forces, do not usually have a high adsorption capacity, since the pore size and hence the surface area are constrained by the large size of typical proteins. It has been suggested (Boschetti, 1994) that recently developed gel-composite media can overcome these limitations. Such materials are obtained by incorporating a hydrogel, which provides ion-exchange sites for interaction with the protein, within a rigid matrix, which provides mechanical strength and resistance to swelling and shrinking. In previous work (Fernandez and Carta, 1996; Fernandez et al., 1996; Weaver and Carta, 1996), we have characterized the uptake equilibria and rates of adsorption of several proteins at low ionic strengths on commercially available gel-composite media known by the trade name HyperD (BioSepra, Inc., Marlborough, MA). These materials have high uptake capacities for typical proteins of about 200\u2212300 mg/cm3 of media. More importantly, they exhibit rapid uptake kinetics. In fact, under conditions favoring binding, mass transfer rates are faster than would be predicted for identical particles in the absence of gel. This effect has been attributed to the nature of the diffusion process in these materials. At low salt concentrations, we have found that mass transfer rates in these particles are consistent with a diffusion model where the driving force is expressed in terms of the bound protein concentration. Since the latter is typically much larger than the external solution concentration, the diffusion flux in the gel-filled pores can be much larger than it would be for diffusion in fluid filled pores, due to the extremely favorable partitioning of binding proteins. As a result of high equilibrium capacity, favorable mass transfer kinetics, and mechanically stable configuration of the particles, high dynamic binding capacities are obtained in columns even at mobile phase flow rates exceeding 7000 cm/hr (Fernandez et al., 1996; Weaver and Carta, 1996). Although low-salt conditions are typical in a protein-capture step, an understanding of equilibrium and transport rates under varying salt concentrations is needed to describe other chromatographic steps and processes. Moreover, a knowledge of the rate of desorption is necessary to describe a complete process. Salt, in fact, is used to recover adsorbed protein in frontal chromatography and to modulate the separation in gradient elution chromatography (Yamamoto et al., 1988). Transport rates in ion exchangers under conditions favoring desorption of the protein, in particular, have been considered only by a few authors in the prior literature. Tsou and Graham (1985), for example, considered adsorption and desorption of protein on dextran-based ion exchangers in batch contactors, but their work was limited to a highly swellable resin and did not address a prediction of desorption rates in columns. Graham and Fook (1982) also considered adsorption and desorption rates for cellulose-based ion exchangers in batch contactors and used an approximate two-film model to describe the effects of external and intraparticle diffusional limitations. Finally, a limited study on the desorption rate of proteins from a polymer-coated silica-based ion exchanger by van der Wiel (1989) showed that the salt-induced desorption rate of protein can be described properly if all the protein is  assumed to be released instantaneously from the pore wall and then to diffuse through the pores. In this work, we have investigated the rates of adsorption and desorption of lysozyme on S-HyperD (BioSepra, Inc., Marlborough, MA) at different salt concentrations. Experimental data are obtained both in an agitated vessel and in a shallow-bed apparatus where hydrodynamic conditions are identical with those found in a packed bed. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of equilibrium and kinetic models to obtain values of characteristic parameters useful in predicting the chromatographic behavior of this stationary phase. Finally, a model is used to predict adsorption/desorption cycles in a column and the predictions are compared with experimental results. Experimental SectionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToMaterials and Methods. The stationary phase used in this work is S-HyperD-M and was obtained from BioSepra, Inc. (Marlborough, MA). S-HyperD consists of polystyrene-coated high-porosity silica particles whose pores have been filled with a poly(acrylamide) hydrogel that has a strong cation exchange functionality. Basic physical property data and pretreatment conditions are given by Weaver and Carta (1996). The porosity of the silica support matrix is 0.65 (value supplied by the manufacturer), and the density of the hydrated particles was determined to be 1.424 g/cm3. The volume-average particle size of the S-HyperD-M sample used in this work (Lot. 4047) is 78 \u03bcm. Chicken egg white lysozyme (crystallized, dialyzed, and lyophilized three times), obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), was used as a model protein for this study. This protein has a pI of about 11, a partial specific volume of 0.7 cm3/g, and an aqueous diffusivity of 1.1 \u00d7 10-6 cm2/s (Mahler and Cordes, 1966). Its dimensions are approximately 4.5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 nm (Whitley et al., 1989). Other chemicals used in this work were also obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) in a 10 mM Na2HPO4 aqueous buffer adjusted to pH 6.5 with acetic acid. Protein concentrations in solution were determined using a Beckman model DU7 spectrophotometer. Equilibrium Experiments. The static uptake capacity was determined from batch experiments as described by Weaver and Carta (1996). Experiments were done with different NaCl concentrations in the range 0\u22121000 mM in the 10 mM Na2HPO4 pH 6.5 buffer. Transient Adsorption and Desorption Experiments. The rates of adsorption and desorption were determined both in an agitated vessel and in a shallow-bed contactor. The agitated vessel system is described in Weaver and Carta (1996). Adsorption rates are obtained by rapidly adding a sample of protein-free particles to a volume of lysozyme solution and measuring the decrease in protein concentration as a function of time. Similarly, desorption rates are obtained by adding a sample of lysozyme-loaded particles to a volume of a salt solution and recording the rise in protein concentration as a function of time. A magnetically driven impeller was used to mix the solution and fully suspend the particles at about 300 rpm. Extraparticle mass transfer in such a system depends on the power input per unit mass (Armenante and Kirwan, 1989) which has been estimated as 450 \u00b1 190 cm2/s3 (Weaver and Carta, 1996). Borst et al. (1997) verified this value by measuring the external mass transfer coefficient, kf, for ion-exchange particles suspended in the same vessel for conditions where the external resistance is known to be controlling and comparing the experimental value with the values predicted from available correlations. For these conditions, the kf-value for lysozyme on S-HyperD-M is estimated using the Armenante and Kirwan correlation to be 0.0020 \u00b1 0.0002 cm/s. This value is in fairly good agreement with the experimentally determined value of kf = 0.0026 cm/s obtained by Weaver and Carta (1996). The shallow-bed contactor is similar to one used by Fernandez et al. (1996) and is a modification of the classic shallow bed technique developed by Boyd et al. (1947). The shallow bed is obtained by packing a thin layer of S-HyperD-M (approximately 0.005 cm3 of particle volume) between two layers of Q-HyperD-M particles in a 0.3 cm diameter, 1.2 cm long stainless steel column. Q-HyperD-M (BioSepra, Inc., Marlborough, MA) has essentially the same particle size distribution of S-HyperD-M, but possesses a strong anion exchange functionality (Fernandez and Carta, 1996). Thus, Q-HyperD particles are completely inert with respect to lysozyme at pH 6.5, where this protein has a strong positive charge. The minicolumn is fitted at both ends with Omnifit endcaps (Omni, Toms River, NJ) with 0.5 \u03bcm stainless steel frits. The exact volume of S-HyperD-M particles packed was too small to be determined accurately by direct measurement. Thus, it was determined by measuring the lysozyme equilibrium uptake capacity of the shallow bed as described below, and comparing the value to the known equilibrium capacity per unit particle volume obtained from batch equilibrium experiments. The shallow-bed assembly was used with the apparatus shown schematically in Figure 1. It comprises a ProSys Chromatography Workstation (BioSepra, Inc., Marlborough, MA) and an electrically actuated flow-switching valve (Valco Instrument Co., Inc., Houston, TX, model ECSF4E). Three of the pumps (labeled P1, P2, and P3 in Figure 1) in the workstation are set to a desired flow rate and pump continuously either to the column or back to the fluid reservoirs as directed by the flow switching valve. A nearly instantaneous switching of flows to the shallow-bed assembly is obtained by rotating the valve position. The latter is controlled by a programmed output signal from the ProSys unit. For an adsorption experiment, the protein solution is fed to the shallow bed for a desired period of time. The bed is then supplied with the buffer solution to remove protein held in the interparticle space. Finally, the amount of protein adsorbed is determined by passing the buffered 500 mM NaCl solution through the shallow bed and determining the area of the elution peak recorded spectrophotometrically at either 254 or 280 nm. The area is converted to mass of protein using calibration curves which were obtained by feeding protein standards. These calibration curves were found to be linear for lysozyme concentrations up to about 2 mg/cm3. A typical UV and conductivity trace obtained for a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/cm3 with an adsorption time of 240 s and a flow rate of 4 cm3/min is shown in Figure 2. Note that breakthrough of protein occurs nearly instantaneously confirming the differential nature of the shallow-bed assembly. Indeed, the residence time  through the S-HyperD-M layer is estimated to be only about 0.3 s. For a desorption experiment, the shallow bed is loaded to equilibrium with a protein solution containing no NaCl. A buffered salt solution with a desired NaCl concentration is then passed through the bed. The amount of protein desorbed up to a particular time since introduction of the salt solution is determined by calculating the area of the elution peak up to that particular time. All area integrations were performed with the ProSys unit software.

An advantage is that adsorption rates are obtained for hydrodynamic conditions similar to those that could be found in a packed column. In addition, measurements are obtained for a constant solution concentration (equal to the feed concentration) which facilitates interpretation of the results. Column Experiments. Frontal loading and salt-step elution chromatographic experiments were conducted in a 0.3-cm-diameter, 10-cm-long glass column (Omni, Toms River, NJ). The same apparatus used for shallow-bed runs was used for these experiments. The column effluent UV absorbance and conductivity were monitored. During elution, for some conditions, the protein effluent concentration rose above 2 mg/cm3. In this case, effluent fractions were collected with a Gilson model 201 fraction collector and analyzed after dilution. Results and AnalysisARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToUptake Equilibrium. Uptake equilibrium isotherms are shown in Figure 3 at different salt concentrations. Results at 0 and 100 mM NaCl obtained by Weaver and Carta (1996) are included in this figure and are in agreement with new determinations. The uptake equilibrium (which is expressed on a particle volume basis) decreases as a function of salt concentration in the range 0\u2212150 mM, with the isotherms becoming progressively more linear. At salt concentrations of 300 mM or greater, no uptake of lysozyme was detectable.  Figure 3 Equilibrium uptake isotherms for lysozyme on S-HyperD-M at different NaCl concentrations. The graph includes data by Weaver and Carta (1996) indicated by filled symbols. Lines are based on eq 1 with parameters from Table 1.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlidePartitioning of charged proteins in charged gels is dependent simultaneously on steric hindrance effects and electrostatic interactions. Some recent theoretical advances have been made in the description of these  systems (Sassi et al., 1996; Johnson and Deen, 1996). However, these theories are generally limited to dilute systems with low charge density. Thus, an empirical approach was deemed necessary here. As shown by several authors (e.g., Tsou and Graham, 1985; Skidmore et al., 1990; Yoshida et al., 1994), the Langmuir isotherm with salt-dependent coefficients often provides an adequate description of protein ion-exchange equilibria: This works well for our system also, when both qm and b are allowed to vary with salt concentration. The parameters qm and b were determined from a nonlinear least-squares fit of the data and their values are given in Table 1. Figure 3 shows the isotherms calculated using these values.  Figure 4 Batch uptake kinetics for lysozyme on S-HyperD-M at different NaCl concentrations. Lines are based on the homogeneous diffusion model with Ds = 7.5 \u00d7 10-9 cm2 and kf = 0.0026 cm/s with equilibrium parameters from Table 1.

The effect of salt concentration on the concentration history during adsorption of lysozyme in the stirred batch apparatus is shown in Figure 4. The initial protein concentration in solution was 1 mg/cm3, and the volume of particles was 0.25 \u00b1 0.01 cm3. Since the equilibrium uptake becomes less favorable as the salt concentration is increased, the curves approach higher asymptotic values going from 0 to 150 mM NaCl. As shown by Weaver and Carta (1996), at 0 mM NaCl, the batch uptake process is described by the following equations that take into account intraparticle and external mass transfer resistances: These equations assume that intraparticle mass transfer occurs via homogeneous diffusion with a driving force expressed as the gradient in the adsorbed solute concentration. Ci is the interfacial protein concentration and is obtained from eq 1. For the case where no NaCl was added, Weaver and Carta (1996) have obtained Ds = 7.5 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s and kf = 0.0026 cm/s. These values were shown to yield consistent predictions when the protein concentration was varied between 0.1 and 2 mg/cm3. Thus, the same values were used to predict the uptake curves shown in Figure 4 at different salt concentrations. For this purpose, eqs 2 and 3 were solved numerically (see Weaver and Carta, 1996) using the equilibrium parameter values summarized in Table 1. As seen in Figure 4, the agreement between experimental results and predicted curves is excellent, especially considering that the initial slope of the isotherm changes by a factor of about 150 when the salt concentration is increased from 0 to 150 mM. It is also of interest to compare these batch uptake curves with the behavior that would be predicted by a pore diffusion model, where the driving force is expressed in terms of a gradient in free protein concentration. The latter, of course, could not exceed the external solution concentration. The relevant equations are given in Weaver and Carta (1996) and express the rate of mass transfer in terms of an effective pore diffusivity, De = \u03b5pD/\u03c4. Curves calculated on the basis of this model are given in Figure 5 in comparison with the experimental results. In each case, the effective diffusivity was adjusted to provide an approximate fit of the experimental curves. Obviously, it is not possible to obtain a good fit of all the data with a single, salt-independent effective diffusivity; in fact, the value of De needed to fit the data decreases as the curvature of the adsorption isotherm decreases. What is even more important is that the effective diffusivity values needed to fit the data at the lower salt concentrations are higher than the free solution diffusivity. Using the aqueous diffusivity of lysozyme of 1.1 \u00d7 10-6 cm2/s, a porosity of 0.65 equal to that of the rigid support matrix, and a tortuosity value of 2 as is typical, gives a De value of about 3.6 \u00d7 10-7 cm2/s, nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the value of De = 2.8 \u00d7 10-6 cm2/s needed to fit the 0 mM NaCl data. The fact that the apparent De values are larger than the estimated effective pore diffusivity is likely a result of the large driving force deriving from the favorable partitioning of protein into the gel-filling of these particles. As the salt concentration is increased, partitioning becomes less favorable, and the apparent effective pore diffusivity decreases.  Figure 5 Batch uptake kinetics for lysozyme on S-HyperD-M at different NaCl concentrations. Lines are based on the pore diffusion model with kf = 0.0026 cm/s and fitted values of the apparent effective pore diffusivity De with equilibrium parameters from Table 1. Data are the same as in Figure 4.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideIt should be noted that in the interpretation of the results, a single concentration-independent effective diffusivity value Ds is used. This value should be regarded as an average over the particle radius since  variations could be expected as a function of protein loading, as a result of coupling of ion fluxes, and as a result of possible local heterogeneity in the physical structure of the particles and in the distribution of ionogenic functional groups. A final note also concerns the effect of particle size. This effect was not specifically investigated in this work. However, it was examined for gel-composite particles of similar structure but with an anion-exchange functionality (Q-HyperD) by Fernandez and Carta (1996) and Fernandez et al. (1996). Results obtained with particles approximately 50 and 80 \u03bcm in diameter showed that the uptake rate varies inversely with the square of the particle size in agreement with Fick's law. A similar result is expected for the particles studied in this work. Two questions remain to be answered:\u2009 (a) Does the use of the particles in a packed bed operated at high velocities of the mobile phase affect the rate of intraparticle mass transfer of lysozyme in S-HyperD? (b) Is the rate of desorption of lysozyme from these particles predicted by the same model? To answer the first question, we conducted adsorption experiments in the shallow-bed apparatus. The results are shown in Figure 6 for lysozyme concentrations of 1 and 0.1 mg/cm3 with a superficial velocity of 3400 cm/h. Calculated curves based on the homogeneous diffusion model (with C = CF constant in eq 2c) with Ds = 7.5 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s and kf = 0.0029 cm/s are also shown in this figure. The diffusivity value is the same obtained from batch experiments. The kf value, however, was obtained by matching the initial slope of the data at 0.1 mg/cm3 protein concentration, to the limiting solution of the model equations with C = CF for the case where the external resistance is controlling: This solution is valid, for short times, when the dimensionless group \u03b4 = kf\u2009rpCF/5qFDs is less than one (Fernandez et al., 1996). For a highly favorable isotherm, as is observed here when no salt is added to the pH 6.5 buffer, this dimensionless group is equivalent to the so-called Helfferich number and is a measure of the relative rates of external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion (Helfferich and Hwang, 1991). For the 0.1 mg/cm3 run in Figure 6, \u03b4 \u223c 0.12. Thus, the external resistance is indeed controlling for these conditions. Conversely, at 1 mg/cm3, \u03b4 becomes larger than unity, so that intraparticle mass transfer becomes dominant except at very short times. The close agreement between shallow-bed results and predictions made with Ds = 7.5 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s indicates that intraparticle mass transfer rates are unaffected by operation in a packed bed as, apparently, the rigid matrix prevents mechanical compression of the polyacrylamide gel contained within the particles.  Figure 6 Shallow-bed uptake kinetics for lysozyme on S-HyperD-M at different protein concentrations. Lines are based on the homogeneous diffusion model with Ds = 7.5 \u00d7 10-9 cm2 and kf = 0.0029 cm/s with equilibrium parameters from Table 1. [NaCl] = 0 mM.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideDesorption Kinetics. To determine the rate of protein desorption in response to a step in salt concentration, desorption experiments were conducted both in the agitated vessel and in the shallow bed apparatus. The results are shown in parts a and b of Figure 7. In both cases, the S-HyperD particles were presaturated with 1 mg/cm3 lysozyme in pH 6.5 buffer, yielding an initial protein loading of about 250 mg/cm3 (see Figure 3). The particles were then exposed to buffered solutions containing different NaCl concentrations. Several interesting trends can be noted. First, it is apparent that the adsorption of lysozyme is reversible over the range of salt concentrations shown in parts a and b of Figure 7. In fact, in the shallow-bed contactor, even at 100 mM salt, the protein will eventually become completely desorbed from the particles. Second, it is clear that the desorption behavior is independent of the NaCl concentration for concentrations of 300 mM or greater. For these conditions there is no tendency to bind lysozyme, and the rate of mass transfer is completely controlled by intraparticle transport. This apparently occurs at the same rate in the range 300\u22121000 mM NaCl. At lower salt concentrations, however, when lysozyme is favorably partitioned in the stationary phase, the desorption behavior is affected by the shape of the isotherm. At 150 mM salt, for example, the time required to attain nearly complete desorption increases from about 200 s to about 1000 s. When the salt concentration is lowered to 100 mM this time exceeds 8000 s as these conditions still strongly favor binding of the protein (see Figure 3). Finally, we can directly compare the 500 and 1000 mM data in Figure 7a with those in Figure 7b since, for these conditions, the protein is completely desorbed even in the batch contactor. Essentially identical curves are obtained in the two contactors. Thus, it is apparent that the desorption  behavior is virtually independent of hydrodynamic conditions outside the particle. This indicates that S-HyperD retains its structural integrity and intraparticle diffusional characteristics at elevated flow rates of the mobile phase even during desorption at high salt concentrations.  Figure 7 Desorption kinetics for lysozyme adsorbed on S-HyperD at different salt concentrations. The particles were initially equilibrated with 1 mg/cm3 lysozyme in pH 6.5 buffer. Key:\u2009 (a) batch kinetics; (b) shallow-bed kinetics. Lines are based on the homogeneous diffusion model with kf = 0.0026 cm/s for the batch runs and kf = 0.0029 cm/s for the shallow bed runs.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideTo compare adsorption and desorption rates, we used the homogeneous diffusion model, eqs 2 and 3 for the batch runs or eq 2 alone with C = CF = 0 for the shallow-bed runs, to predict the desorption behavior. Calculated curves for Ds = 7.5 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s using the isotherm parameters in Table 1 are shown by the solid lines in parts a and b of Figure 7. At 100 and 150 mM salt concentrations, it appears that only relatively minor differences exist between experimental and predicted curves, indicating that, for these low-salt conditions, mass transfer mechanisms are similar for both adsorption and desorption. The relatively small differences observed between experimental and predicted behavior could be attributed, at least in part, to inaccuracies in the determination and fitting of the isotherms. In addition, differences could also arise because the diffusivity is likely to vary to some extent with protein loading. At salt concentrations of 300 mM or higher, however, a different behavior is observed. In this case, the desorption rate is seen to be substantially higher than predicted. In fact, while the same model could be used to fit the experimental data, a substantially higher diffusivity value of 20 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s was needed. Predicted curves based on this value are shown by the dashed lines in parts a and b of Figure 7. It is apparent that this Ds value provides a good fit of all data at high salt concentrations both in the batch and in the shallow-bed contactor. For these high salt conditions, of course, there is no tendency to bind lysozyme, so that it is reasonable to expect that less diffusional hindrance will occur as compared to the cases where protein binding is significant. Comparison of Experimental and Estimated Diffusivity. It is of interest to compare these diffusivity values with available theories for transport of macromolecules in fibrous gels. No theory is currently available for transport of a cationic macromolecule in an anionic gel. However, theories for neutral species are available, such as the effective-medium model used by Howells (1974) and Phillips et al. (1989, 1990). According to this model, the ratio of diffusivities in a gel and in solution is given by where rm is the radius of the diffusing molecule and k is the hydraulic Darcy permeability. This equation has had some success in predicting the diffusion behavior in free gels (Phillips et al., 1989, Tong and Anderson, 1996). For spherical solutes, rm can be estimated from the Stokes\u2212Einstein radius (rm = 1.98 nm for lysozyme). The Darcy permeability, k, can be calculated for well-defined geometries (Howells, 1974; Phillips et al., 1989) or measured experimentally for more complex systems. Kapur et al. (1996) have recently measured the hydrodynamic permeability of charged poly(acrylamide) gels (S and Q) supported in rigid porous membranes. The gels used by these authors are equivalent to those used in preparing HyperD and the membranes used to support the gel have pore size and porosity similar to the silica matrix of the HyperD particles. For the S-gel, Kapur et al. found that k has little sensitivity to salt concentration and gave values of (0.15 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10-14 cm2 for a range of ionic strengths between 10 and 1000 mM. Using this value in eq 5 yields Dg \u223c 7.4 \u00d7 10-8 cm2/s for lysozyme. To compare this value with the Ds values reported in this work, it is necessary to make allowances for the porosity and tortuosity factor of the rigid support matrix of S-HyperD. Using values of 0.65 and 2 for these parameters as before, an effective diffusivity of 0.65 \u00d7 7.4 \u00d7 10-8/2 = 24 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s can be estimated for transport in S-HyperD of a neutral molecule of the same size of lysozyme. This value is close to the effective diffusivity Ds obtained experimentally at high salt concentrations, where the electrostatic interaction between lysozyme and the gel's functional groups is presumably suppressed. A lower value of the effective diffusivity was, however, obtained at low salt concentrations, for conditions were the protein is very favorably partitioned. In fact, even at 150 mM salt concentrations, the partition coefficient at 1 mg/cm3 protein concentration exceeds 100. For these conditions, essentially all of the protein contained in the particles is in a bound form. The electrostatic interaction responsible for solute binding apparently increases diffusional hindrance within the gel. Prediction of Breakthrough and Elution Behavior. The results of four successive experimental runs conducted at a mobile phase superficial velocity of 3400 cm/h with a 10 cm-long column are shown in Figure 8a\u2212d. Each experiment involved loading the column with 1 mg/cm3 lysozyme in pH 6.5 buffer for 2400 s, followed by a wash step for 1260 s where only buffer was supplied to the column, and by an elution step, where a buffered salt solution was fed. Four different salt concentrations (100, 150, 500, and 1000 mM) were used in the elution step. As the salt concentration is increased, a sharper elution peak is obtained since equilibrium becomes less and less favorable. However, there is no significant difference between the elution peaks at 500 and 1000 mM salt since equilibrium limitations are completely removed at these concentrations.  Figure 8 Comparison of experimental and predicted loading/wash/elution cycles for lysozyme in a 10 cm long S-HyperD-M column operated at 3400 cm/h. Loading was with 1 mg/cm3 lysozyme in pH 6.5 buffer; wash was with pH 6.5 buffer; elution was with (a) 100 mM NaCl, (b) 150 mM NaCl, (c) 500 mM NaCl, and (d) 1000 mM NaCl.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint Slide Figure 9 Salt breakthrough profile for the 10 cm-long S-HyperD-M column at 3400 cm/h. Experimental results are shown for the clean column and the column preequilibrated with 1 mg/cm3 lysozyme in pH 6.5 buffer. The latter traces correspond to the experiments in parts a and c Figure7. The salt step is applied at t = 3660 s.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideNeglecting axial dispersion, protein loading and wash steps are described by the following equations representing solute balances for the column and adsorbent particles where \u03b5 is the void fraction and u is the superficial velocity. Equations 6 and 7, coupled with the particle conservation equation, eq 2, and with the equilibrium isotherm, eq 1, were solved numerically by orthogonal collocation using a method similar to that of Saunders et al. (1989). It should be noted that while simpler constant-pattern solutions can be used for the protein loading step (Weaver and Carta, 1996; Fernandez et al., 1996), a numerical solution is required for the wash and  elution steps since equilibrium is favorable. A value of \u03b5 = 0.47, determined by matching the total column capacity to the equilibrium capacity, was used for these calculations. This value is in agreement with previous direct determinations of the void fraction of HyperD columns (Fernandez et al., 1996). The results are shown by the solid curves in Figure 8a\u2212d. There is an excellent agreement between experimental breakthrough and predicted curves. Some discrepancies are observed in the wash step, where leakage of protein from the column is overestimated by the model. This discrepancy is likely a result of inaccuracies in the determination of the adsorption isotherm at very low protein concentrations. As shown in Figure 3, the isotherm at 0 mM salt is extremely steep. Thus, the desorption curve during the wash step is extremely sensitive to even small changes in the slope of the isotherm at these low concentrations. To predict the elution behavior, it is necessary to understand how the salt propagates through the column. In principle, an exact model would require a description of salt\u2212protein interactions. In practice, however, we found that this is not strictly necessary. Figure 9 shows the salt breakthrough profiles (obtained from conductivity measurements) for elutions with 100 and 500 mM salt for two extreme cases; in the first, the column was free of protein, and in the second, the column was saturated with protein prior to the salt step. The runs in the second case correspond to the experiments in parts a and c of Figure 8. It is apparent that movement of salt through the column occurs very rapidly and, over this range, is virtually independent of salt concentration and of whether the packing is saturated with protein or not. This occurs principally because the salt is in large equivalent excess over the adsorbed protein. As a result, for a practical prediction of the elution behavior it is sufficient to assume that the entire column is instantaneously exposed to the salt concentration in the eluent. Equations 6 and 7 coupled with eqs 1 and 2 can thus be used with the appropriate initial conditions. Numerically calculated curves based on these equations and the independently determined equilibrium parameters are shown in Figure 8a\u2212d. Values of Ds = 7.5 \u00d7 10-9 and 20 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s were used for the 100 and 150 mM and for the 500 and 1000 mM elutions, respectively, in accordance with the batch and shallow-bed determinations. An excellent agreement is obtained in all cases, demonstrating that the model developed captures the essential traits of equilibrium and transport processes in these particles. Obviously, since there is no equilibrium uptake of protein and the same diffusivity value is used, curves predicted at 500 and 1000 mM salt concentrations, are identical as is observed experimentally. In this case, essentially complete recovery of the protein is obtained in about 540 s. Much longer times are required at 150 mM. At 100 mM salt concentration, even after 3600 s from the beginning of the salt step, recovery of the protein initially adsorbed is only about 72%. The elution profile, in this case, extends to very long times. However, we observed that any residual protein could be quickly eluted by switching the eluent to one containing a higher salt concentration. SummaryARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToIntraparticle mass transfer of lysozyme in the gel-composite S-HyperD particles is consistent with a diffusion model where the driving force is the gradient in total protein concentration within the particle. At low protein concentrations and when equilibrium partitioning is favorable, the external resistance to mass transfer becomes dominant. For salt concentrations in the range 0\u2212150 mM, a single effective diffusivity Ds = 7.5 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s adequately describes intraparticle transport for both adsorption and desorption conditions. Thus, over this range, differences in the mass transfer rates observed with different salt concentrations can be ascribed entirely to differences in the equilibrium isotherms. At higher salt concentrations, when there is no tendency to bind lysozyme, a higher Ds value is needed to describe the experimental behavior with this model. This increase could reflect an increased mobility of the protein molecules within the gel in the absence of binding. This higher Ds value, however, remains independent of salt in the range 300\u22121000 mM. Estimates of intraparticle diffusivities based on experimental values of the gel Darcy permeability of Kapur et al. (1996) appear to support the physical significance of these effective diffusivity determinations. The unique structure of this gel-composite medium results in a large protein uptake capacity and a rapid mass transfer kinetics. As a consequence of the mechanical strength of the support matrix, these desirable properties are preserved when the particles are used in a packed bed operated at an extremely high flow rate of the mobile phase. A model based on the independently determined equilibrium and rate parameters is shown to provide an excellent prediction of loading/wash/elution cycles for lysozyme in a chromatographic column packed with S-HyperD. Such a model could be used for an optimization of step times in a protein recovery process.

The method takes advantage of the difference in refractive index between the protein-free and protein-saturated adsorbent matrix. When the particles are viewed with an ordinary microscope using white light illumination, the adsorption front appears as a bright ring that moves in time from the surface of the particle to its center. Experimental data are obtained for the proteins lysozyme and albumin with a commercial agarose-based cation exchanger. Sharp rings are observed in both cases confirming that protein mass transfer within the particles occurs via a shell-progressive diffusion mechanism. Quantitative analysis based on the shrinking core model provides an accurate and precise way of determining the intraparticle diffusivity for individual particles as a function of protein concentration and mobile phase composition.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsAdsorptionDiffusionVisualizationProteinsChromatographyRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Two peaks are obtained when the bound protein is eluted with either a NaCl gradient or with two NaCl steps at increasing concentration. The first, early eluting peak contains only monomeric species whose structure is consistent with the native monomer. The second, late eluting peak contains a mixture of monomeric and aggregated species. The monomeric species in this mixture is also found to have a structure consistent with that of the native mAb, showing no evidence of increased solvent exposure. The aggregated species show instead significant unfolding in areas of the protein structure contained within the Fc region. The same peptides that exhibit the greatest level of solvent exposure in the aggregated species are also found in the fraction of protein that elutes from the resin only at high salt concentration, indicating that the aggregates are formed when the strongly-bound unfolded intermediate is desorbed at high salt. There is no evidence that the unfolded intermediate, formed while the protein is bound on the resin, is present in any of the eluted fractions indicating that, upon desorption from the resin, the intermediate either quickly refolds or forms aggregates which end-up co-eluting with the refolded protein at high salt concentrations.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMonoclonal antibodyCation exchangeUnfoldingAggregationHydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometryRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The reaction is equilibrium limited, and accumulation of water on the biocatalyst causes a reduction in biocatalytic activity. As a result simultaneous removal of water by adsorption on a catalytically inert ion-exchange resin in Na form has been used to improve conversion. A three-zone SMBR system was developed for this purpose integrating reaction, adsorption, and regeneration. The packed beds in the three zones are periodically advanced in a \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d fashion to simulate countercurrent flow. The SMBR allows continuous operation while reducing desorbent consumption and improving conversion relative to a conventional fixed-bed reactor. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the SMBR system based on independent analyses of adsorption and reaction phenomena. The model takes into account the interplay of these phenomena and provides a useful tool to understand the effects of process variables and for the selection of optimum operating conditions. * \u2009Corresponding author.

Much of the industrial interest stems from the chemospecificity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity that is often exhibited by these biocatalysts. 2-6 Moreover, enzymes are thought to be more environmentally friendly than many conventional catalysts and work at moderate temperatures and pH. Esterifications are among the most industrially interesting reactions in this area. 7 However, while, these reactions are of great interest for the synthesis of flavors and fragrances, pharmaceutical intermediates, and specialty chemicals, they are often subject to thermodynamic equilibrium limitations 8-10 as well as to loss of catalytic activity when water produced in the reaction accumulates on the biocatalyst. 11 Thus, in general, the water produced in these reactions must be controlled in order to attain high conversions and preserve the biocatalyst activity. It has been suggested 12,13 that water can be controlled by limiting its thermodynamic activity in the reaction mixture, because that in turn controls the reaction equilibrium and the partitioning of substrates and products between the reaction mixture and the biocatalyst. Several approaches have been proposed to achieve this, including the use of salt hydrates 14 pervaporation through water-selective membranes, 15,16 free and vacuum evaporation, 17 distillation, 18 and air sparging. 19 Adsorption onto a water-selective medium has also been considered by a number of authors 17,20 and is of particular interest because of the ease with which adsorbents can be incorporated into packed bed reactors that are often preferred for enzymatic conversions. 21,22 For example, Mensah et al. 11,23 and Migliorini et al. 24 have shown that catalytically inert ion-exchange resins are effective for in situ control of water in enzymatic reactions, with the advantage that removal of the adsorbed water can be done with a polar solvent, without having to separate the biocatalyst from the adsorbent. However, to obtain a continuous operation of adsorptive reactor, systems that integrate reaction, separation, and regeneration steps efficiently are desirable. Simulated moving bed reactor (SMBR) systems have been developed for this purpose. SMBR systems simulate a countercurrent flow of the adsorbent/catalyst and the fluid phase through the use of multiple fixed beds advanced in a \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d fashion. The technology draws upon the success of simulated moving bed separators that are now used extensively on a large scale 25 but incorporates a reactive component. As such, they retain the advantages of true countercurrent reactor systems without the operational complexities of actually moving adsorbent/catalyst particles. A number of laboratory studies of SMBR systems have appeared in the literature in recent years, including reactors for the hydrogenation of mesitylene, 26-29 for the oxidative coupling of methane, 30-32 and for a number of sulfonic acid resin catalyzed esterifications, transesterifications, and acetylations. 33-35 Some experimental applications to enzyme-catalyzed reactions have also been studied such as the enzymatic isomerization of glucose to fructose 36 and lipase-catalyzed transesterifications, 37 and a number of theoretical studies of adsorptive reactors have been conducted. 38-41 However, despite these studies, no industrial scale applications of adsorptive SMBR have been reported. It is hoped that a better understanding of the interplay of adsorptive and reaction phenomena and the exploration of the potential for applications in critical fields such as biocatalysis will allow practical implementation of these reactors. It should be noted that biocatalytic reactions are good candidates because the temperature is low so that adsorption can be effective. The objective of this work is to determine the suitability of an SMBR system for a reversible regioselective enzymatic esterification. The reaction considered is the lipase-catalyzed esterification of propionic acid and 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol to form the primary monoester and water according to The reaction occurs in a nearly anhydrous hexane solvent and is equilibrium limited (K = 0.6 at 22 \u00b0C).24 The biocatalyst is Lipozyme IM (Novo Nordisk Bioindustrials, Inc., Franklinton, NC) and consists of a Mucor miehei lipase immobilized on a macroporous polymeric support. Direct conversions of diols to their monoester are of considerable importance as these products have applications in cosmetics, pharmaceutical intermediates, and surfactants.2 Biocatalytic routes are often desirable for these applications because of regulatory and selectivity considerations. High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe Lipozyme biocatalyst used in this work is highly selective for the primary monoester and exhibits long-term stability. However, as shown by Migliorini et al.,24 accumulation of water on the biocatalyst reduces its catalytic activity. Thus, adsorption of water onto the biocatalyst must be prevented to maintain the highest reaction rates. Migliorini at al. studied the adsorption-assisted operation of this reaction by incorporating an ion-exchange resin as a water adsorbent together with the biocatalyst in batch and fixed-bed reactors. In situ water removal was shown to provide two distinct advantages:\u2009 it shifted the thermodynamic equilibrium toward high conversion and it prevented accumulation of water on the biocatalyst, maintaining high activity. Since these advantages are realized only during transient operation of these reactors, the application of an SMBR system integrating reaction, adsorption, and regeneration is developed in this work. SMBR SystemARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToThe SMBR considered in this work is shown schematically in Figure 1. It consists of three separate zones with intermediate feed and product withdrawal points. The acid substrate feed is supplied continuously to zone III, while the diol substrate feed is supplied continuously to zone I. A \u201craffinate\u201d stream containing the ester product is recovered from zone III, while an \u201cextract\u201d stream containing the water product and excess diol fed to the system is withdrawn from zone I. Each zone comprises multiple beds, and the inner arrow shows the direction of bed switching. In practice, of course, this motion is obtained by the periodic switching of valves. The switching time, p, is related to the equivalent solid and liquid velocities in a true countercurrent system by the following equations: where \u03b5 is the bed void fraction, L is the bed length, and ui is the fluid-phase velocity. The latter is different in each zone as a result of the addition or withdrawal of streams.  Figure 1 Simulated moving bed reactor concept.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe role played by the different zones in the SMBR is as follows. Zone III serves as the reaction/separation zone. In this zone the acid substrate reacts with the diol entering from zone II to form the ester and water. The water produced is adsorbed and is carried upstream by the solid phase with each successive switch. The bulk of the adsorbed water is removed in zone I by the diol substrate, which is fed in amounts in excess of the stoichiometric reaction requirement. The regenerated adsorbent is thus returned to zone III. The excess diol and desorbed water are purged from the system in the extract stream, which is withdrawn between zones I and II. A portion of the diol stream emerging from zone I enters zone II. The function of this zone is to remove water from the diol, preventing a high water concentration from entering the reaction/separation zone (zone III) and preventing the acid and ester produced near the entrance of zone III from being lost in the extract. Figure 1 shows two beds in each zone. While more beds could be added, it has been shown that most of the benefits of the true countercurrent operation can be gained even with only a single bed in each zone. The correct operation of the SMBR requires the selection of fluid velocities in such a way that the adsorbed species (e.g., water) move in the appropriate direction in each zone. Thus, the fluid velocity in the reaction/adsorption zone must be such as to prevent the water produced in the reaction from breaking through in the raffinate. Conversely, the diol feed flow rate must be sufficiently high so that water will be desorbed in zone I and move toward the extract withdrawal point. Finally, the fluid velocity in zone II must be sufficiently low that water is transported by the solid phase toward the extract withdrawal point. Experimental SectionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToMaterials and Methods. Lipozyme IM was obtained from Novo Nordisk Bioindustrials, Inc., (Franklinton, NC). The biocatalyst has a particle size of 0.04 \u00b1 0.02 cm and a porosity of 0.53 \u00b1 0.02. The initial water content of the fresh Lipozyme IM used in this work was 2.4 \u00b1 0.4 mmol/g, determined through weight loss on drying in an oven at 120 \u00b0C. The adsorbent used in this work is Dowex HCR\u2212W2 in Na+ form (Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI). This is a sulfonated, gel-type polystyrene\u2212divinylbenzene resin with a nominal degree of cross-linking of 8%. The resin consists of spherical particles 0.04 \u00b1 0.02 cm in size. It was converted to the sodium form with 1 N  sodium hydroxide, rinsed with deionized distilled water, and dried in an oven at 120 \u00b0C. Propionic acid (99% purity), 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol (97% purity), and hexane (capillary GC grade) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The feed solutions were kept nearly anhydrous by storing them under the Dowex adsorbent material. A 80/100 mesh Chromosorb 101 column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) was used with a Hewlett-Packard model 5890A gas chromatograph (thermal conductivity detection) for analysis. SMBR Apparatus. A schematic of the SMBR apparatus is shown in Figure 2. For simplicity the diagram shows only three beds (one per zone), although the apparatus could accommodate as many as ten beds. Glass chromatographic columns 1.5 cm in diameter (Omnifit, Toms River, NJ) were used, each containing 2 g of Dowex resin and 4 g of the Lipozyme biocatalyst. The two materials were intimately mixed and poured in the columns. The settled bed height was 7.1 \u00b1 0.1 cm. The total void fraction of these columns was estimated to be 0.66, based on \u03b5b = 0.4 and the porosity of Lipozyme. Metering pumps with accuracy of \u00b10.01 cm3/min (Eldex A-60-S and Eldex B-100-S, Napa, CA) were used to feed the acid and diol streams dissolved in hexane and withdraw the extract stream. The flow rate of the remaining stream (the raffinate) is determined by a mass balance. The desired stream routing is accomplished using rotary stream selector valves (model C25Z-3180E, Valco Instrument Company, Inc., Houston, TX). Check valves (model CV 3000, Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) are placed between each column to prevent backflow. Connections between the columns and valves were made with 1/16 in. PTFE tubing. Samples were collected from the raffinate and extract streams at predetermined time intervals. To prevent evaporation of these samples, a Gilson model 231 autoinjector was modified to automatically collect the raffinate samples and inject them into septum-capped glass vials.  Figure 2 Simulated moving bed reactor apparatus. \u2009High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideSynchronized switching of the valves was accomplished using electric actuators (model E10, Valco Instrument Company, Inc., Houston, TX) interfaced to a PC-based control system. All experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. A summary of operating conditions for the different SMBR runs is given in Table 1. In each case, the desorbent fed to zone I was 3 mol/L diol in hexane. A high diol concentration is desirable because it lowers the thermodynamic activity of water that, in turn, is more efficient for desorption. However, since the diol is rather viscous (\u03bc = 2.8 cp for 3 mol/L diol in hexane at 25 \u00b0C), this concentration was used as a compromise. Varied numbers of beds per zone, flow rates, and switch times were used in the different runs.

For certain idealized conditions (e.g., linear isotherms or Langmuir isotherms) and in the absence of mass transfer and kinetic effects, these operating conditions can be selected on the basis of explicit expressions (see Lode et al.).41 In our case, however, reaction kinetic effects and mass transfer resistances are substantial. Moreover, the adsorption equilibria are dependent on the thermodynamic activity coefficients, which, in turn, vary dramatically as a function the composition of the reactions mixture and, thus, with conversion. A detailed mathematical model was thus developed based on independently determined rate expressions. The equations used to simulate the SMBR system are summarized in Table 2 and are based on the fixed-bed model developed by Migliorini et al.24 Each bed is assumed to be uniformly packed with a homogeneous mixture of the biocatalyst (bed density \u03c1c = 0.32 g/cm3) and the adsorbent (bed density \u03c1a = 0.16 g/cm3). The model comprises (a) the conservation equations (eq 2.1) for each fixed bed assuming axially dispersed plug flow; (b) boundary conditions and mass balances to describe the addition and removal of the fluid streams (eqs 2.2a\u2212f); (c) rate equations based on the LDF approximation (eqs 2.3a\u2212b) to describe the rates of mass transfer between the fluid phase and the biocatalyst and between the fluid phase and the adsorbent; (d) the rate equation for the reaction (eqs 2.4a\u2212b); and (d) adsorption isotherms describing the equilibrium distribution of substrates and products between the fluid phase and the adsorbent and between the fluid phase and the biocatalyst (eqs 2.5a\u2212c). The effects of intercolumn dead volumes were found to be negligible in our experimental system. Thus, this volume was neglected in the mass balances and boundary conditions connecting adjacent columns.

Superscripts:\u2009 c = catalyst, a = adsorbent, F = feed value, 0 = bed inlet, L = end of bed, * = equilibrium value.The reaction kinetics is described by the reversible Ping Pong Bi\u2212Bi rate expression including substrate inhibition (eq 2.4a) according to the results of Migliorini et al.24 Since the amount of adsorbed water on Lipozyme IM has a strong effect on the biocatalyst activity but no effect on the substrate concentration dependence of the rate,11 the maximum rate parameter rm in the rate  expression is a strong function of the water content of the biocatalyst, qWc. This relationship is expressed by an empirical function (eq 2.4.b). Accordingly, the reaction rate is maximum when qWc\u21920, it remains nearly constant up to qWc\u223c3 mmol/g, and then decreases rapidly over the range of qWc = 3.5 to 6.5 mmol/g to a lower limit where the rate is only 30% of the initial value.24 As a result, it is desirable to keep the adsorbed water concentration on the biocatalyst at or below 3 mmol/g. This water content will be referred to as the \u201cdeactivation limit\u201d. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms are used to describe the partitioning of solutes for both the biocatalyst and the adsorbent resin. As shown by Migliorini et al.,24 only two of the components are significantly adsorbed:\u2009 propionic acid, which is adsorbed on the biocatalyst only, and water, which is adsorbed on both the biocatalyst and the adsorbent resin. In both cases, the adsorption isotherms are expressed as empirical functions of the thermodynamic activity in the reaction mixture, which were calculated using the UNIFAC model 42 with the parameter set of Hansen et al. 43 Inclusion of activity coefficients is necessary in this system because of the highly nonideal nature of the reaction mixture. The latter causes the thermodynamic activity and, hence, the adsorption isotherm, to vary dramatically as a function of conversion. As shown by Migliorini et al.,24 the water adsorption isotherms are S-shaped (type V) when plotted as a function of aW. For low aW values, water adsorption on the resin is about four times greater than on the biocatalyst. Adsorption of propionic acid on the biocatalyst follows a favorable type I isotherm, but the maximum amount adsorbed is low for our experimental conditions. All of the model parameters, with the exception of the axial dispersion coefficient, were determined by Migliorini et al.24 and are summarized in Table 3. The activity of the biocatalyst sample used in this work was lower than that used by Migliorini et al.;24 however, the concentration dependence and the effect of adsorbed water were the same. As a result, the only variation is the value of the rate coefficient .

First, breakthrough experiments using n-octane as a nonadsorbed tracer in hexane were  performed.23 A Peclet number Pe = udp/\u03b5bDL = 0.3 was found, in good agreement with the Peclet number predicted by the correlation of Chung and Wen. 44 Tracer experiments were then done using 3 mol/L diol in hexane. These experimental results are shown in Figure 3 along with model calculations. Although the diol is not adsorbed, the results of positive and negative concentration steps are quite different. In both cases, the stoichiometric centers of the curves occur at V/Vc \u223c 0.66, which coincides with the total void fraction of the column. However, while the positive concentration step yields a sharp curve, the negative concentration step yields a strongly tailing curve. This difference is attributable to viscous fingering. This is likely to occur when the more viscous diol solution (\u03bc = 2.8 cp) is displaced by the less viscous hexane solvent (\u03bc = 0.33 cp). In this case, the less viscous displacing fluid forms \u201cfingers\u201d that extend into the more viscous fluid at the rear boundary between the two fluids. These fingers become increasingly pronounced as the displacing fluid moves through the column, resulting in a long elution tail. Conversely, viscous fingering is not expected to affect the response to the positive concentration step because, in this case, the viscosity difference actually stabilizes the front. Figure 3 Experimental and predicted diol profiles. Experimental conditions:\u2009 3.0 mol/L diol, diol loading step u = 0.13 cm/min, hexane rinse step u = 0.15 cm/min, L = 7.1 cm.

Conditions are given in Table 1. \u2009High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideAs seen in Figure 3, while Pe = 0.3 provides a good prediction of the response to the positive concentration step, a much lower Pe value is needed to fit the response to the negative concentration step. It should be noted that in describing the SMBR system, axial dispersion and viscous fingering affect different components to a different extent. They have the greatest effect on the nonadsorbed species (the diol and the ester), while they are expected to have almost no effect on the adsorbed components (water and propionic acid), for which mass transfer resistances are dominant. Moreover, the effects of viscous fingering are expected to be different in the different zones of the SMBR system. Thus, to simplify the analysis, a single Pe value was used in the model simulations, chosen to provide the best fit of the SMBR data. A value of Pe = 0.06 was optimal and is intermediate between the two Pe values obtained in the diol tracer experiments. This value of Pe was used in all the simulations. More rigorous models incorporating an explicit description of viscous fingering could be developed. 45 However, it will be shown that the approximate modeling approach used in this work produces results in reasonable agreement with the experimental data without occurring in the detailed description of the fluid mechanics of viscous fingering which, as a minimum, would require a two-dimensional transient model. Results and DiscussionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToExperimental results for SMBR run A are shown in Figure 4. The top figure shows the raffinate concentrations while the bottom figure shows those for the extract stream. This run corresponds to a 1\u22121\u22121 SMBR configuration with one bed in zone I, one bed in zone II, and one bed in zone III. Starting with initially clean beds, the concentrations build up in the system gradually during the first few cycles. As a result of the periodic switching of beds, a periodic steady-state is reached by  the fourth cycle. At this point the effluent concentrations become periodic functions of time with a period equal to the bed switching time. A better understanding of the interplay of the zones and of the periodic steady-state profiles can be obtained by plotting the raffinate concentrations as a function of the number of column volumes in zone III, V/Vc, rather than time. The results for the fifth period are shown in Figure 5 on an enlarged scale. At the start of the period, the bed that was just moved to zone III is filled with the 3 mol/L diol feed solution. Thus, initially, a high concentration of diol is seen in the raffinate. This diol is then rapidly displaced as this bed fills with the zone III feed. As this occurs the concentration of the ester formed in the reaction begins to rise. As shown by Migliorini et al.,24 the acid in zone III forms a reactive front whose speed depends on both the reaction rate and its adsorption isotherm. Downstream of this front no reaction takes place because the acid is absent. Thus, initially, only a portion of the reactor zone is active. As seen in Figure 5, the maximum ester concentration is attained approximately when the acid breaks through. When this occurs, acid and diol are simultaneously present throughout the length of the reactor zone and the maximum rate of ester production is obtained. It can be seen that the water concentration is kept very low in the raffinate. When the water begins to break through, the ester concentration begins to decline, indicating that equilibrium limitations have reduced the reaction rate. The extract profiles in Figure 4b demonstrate the regeneration of the adsorbent in zone I. During the first few cycles the beds contained little water so that the water concentration in the extract is low. By the third cycle, water produced by the reaction in zone III begins to appear in the extract, building up until the periodic steady state is reached.

In general there is a good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data for both the extract and raffinate. In fact, the agreement is quite impressive when one considers that  the thermodynamic activity coefficient of water varies over 2 orders of magnitude in the reactor zone for these experimental conditions. The initial acid breakthrough is not as well predicted. Most likely this is due to slight inaccuracies in the description of the highly favorable acid adsorption isotherm24 and by the fact that the LDF approximation is used to describe the rate of adsorption. The corresponding predicted axial profiles of adsorbed water on the biocatalyst and the adsorbent in zones I and III are shown in Figure 6 at the end of the period in the periodic steady state. The profiles in zone I show that both the Dowex resin and Lipozyme are sufficiently regenerated. The biocatalyst leaving zone I is in the fully active state (adsorbed water less than 3 mmol/g). Similarly, there is a very low concentration of water adsorbed on Lipozyme in zone III as most of the water formed in the reaction is adsorbed on the Dowex resin. Since the biocatalyst remains below 3 mmol/g of adsorbed water, full activity is maintained throughout the period. For these conditions, the conversion attained is limited by the rate of reaction and the reaction equilibrium, since the simultaneous removal of water keeps the biocatalyst away from the deactivation limit. The effect of adding a second bed to the reaction/adsorption zone (run B) is shown in Figure 7. The flow rates in this 1\u22121\u22122 SMBR configuration are the same as in run A. Thus the residence time in zone III is doubled. The extract and raffinate concentration profiles are qualitatively similar to the previous run. However, in this case a nearly complete conversion of the acid substrate occurs, and a much higher conversion of the diol leads to a higher purity ester product. Correspondingly, a higher concentration of water is seen in the extract (Figure 7b). Figure 8 shows the effect of adding a third bed to the reaction/adsorption zone. For simplicity, only the final five cycles are shown (from 12 to 27 h). For this 1\u22121\u22123 SMBR configuration (run C), the diol substrate concentration approaches small values in the raffinate stream toward the end of the period, resulting in an even higher ester purity. The corresponding predicted axial adsorbed water profiles in zone III are shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that although most of the water produced is adsorbed on the Dowex resin, the adsorbed water concentration on the biocatalyst has risen slightly above the 3 mmol/g deactivation limit in the first 40% of the first bed. This suggests that the switch time is near the maximum because any increase, corresponding to a decrease of the equivalent adsorbent velocity (see eq 1a), would cause further accumulation of water and a reduction in the catalytic activity.

Profiles are shown at the end of the period. \u2009High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe effect of increasing the switch time to 240 min for the 1\u22121\u22123 configuration is shown in Figure 10. The acid feed rate is the same as run C. However, the diol feed rate and the extract flow rates are lower. Conversion of the acid is, however, now far from being complete, and a significant acid concentration breaks through. The adsorbed water profiles are shown in  Figure 11. In this case, the adsorbed water concentration has risen above the deactivation limit over the entire length of the first bed as well a portion of the second bed. The lower reaction rates caused by the accumulation of water, in turn, resulted in a lower conversion of the acid substrate. Since the diol feed rate was reduced for this run, a higher concentration of water is seen in the extract (Figure 10b).

Experimental conditions of Figure 10. \u2009High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideFinally, the effect of adding an additional bed to the regeneration zone, zone I, is shown in Figure 12 (run E). The addition of another bed to the desorption section is expected to increase the desorption efficiency, allowing the diol feed flow rate to be lowered while maintaining a similar amount of regeneration. In this run, the diol feed flow rate was reduced from 0.77 to 0.40 cm3/min while keeping the switching time equal to 180 min and the acid feed flow rate equal to 0.11 cm3/min. The experimental and predicted raffinate profiles are quite similar to those obtained in the 1\u22121\u22122 configuration (see Figure 7). The extract water concentration profiles are quite different, however, as in this case a much smaller amount of diol feed is used as a desorbent. Because essentially the same amount of water is produced and recovered in the extract as in run C, the efficiency of using the desorbent has been increased substantially by the countercurrent operation with two beds in series in zone I. The axial profiles of adsorbed water corresponding to this run are shown in Figure 13 at the end of the period in the periodic steady state. As seen from these profiles, at the end of the period the first bed in zone I is regenerated sufficiently so that the water adsorbed on the biocatalyst is below the deactivation limit while more than half of the water adsorbed on the Dowex resin has been removed. Process Performance Parameters. In general, the optimization of the SMBR is dependent on the definition of an economic objective function. However, for simplicity, only the acid conversion and the ester purity in the raffinate stream were used in this work to compare different experimental conditions. A summary of the experimental and predicted values for these two quantities is given in Table 4 for periodic steady state conditions. The acid conversion is based on the period-average concentration in the raffinate, while the ester purity is calculated from the average raffinate concentrations excluding the bed void volume. These quantities can be compared directly with the corresponding equilibrium values for a nonseparating plug flow reactor,  which are calculated from the following relationships: where x* is the equilibrium conversion of the acid. For feed concentrations of the acid and diol substrates of 1 and 3 mol/L, we obtain x* = 67% and an ester purity of 17%. As seen in Table 4, the SMBR runs achieved both acid conversion and ester purity much higher than the corresponding equilibrium values. Increasing the number of beds in zone III from one to three (runs A\u2212C) increases the acid conversion and the ester purity because of the longer residence time. Increasing the switching time from 180 to 240 min (runs C and D) increases the average ester purity in the raffinate because the diol concentration is reduced to a low value. Finally, including an additional bed in zone I (run E) yields a performance similar to that of run B, but with greatly reduced diol consumption.

Previously, this coupling has been shown to enhance the rate and ultimate conversion in batch reactors as well as the conversion during the transient operation of fixed-bed reactors.24 While these adsorptive reactors offered these advantages over conventional reactors, their operation was necessarily discontinuous. A continuous SMBR system, integrating reaction, adsorption of water, and regeneration, has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The process operates in a nearly continuous manner while overcoming equilibrium limitations and preventing deactivation of the biocatalyst by adsorbed water. The SMBR system offered two additional advantages:\u2009 reduced desorbent consumption due to maximizing the driving force for desorption through countercurrent operation, and internal recycle through zone II of a portion of the diol used as the regenerant. A mathematical model, based on independently determined descriptions of adsorption and reaction phenomena, was developed to predict the behavior of the SMBR system. In all cases, model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results obtained in our laboratory scale system. Ester concentration profiles were predicted well, whereas the diol concentration profiles were predicted less accurately because of strong tailing behavior of this species. These predictions are impressive when one considers that they are dependent on the simultaneous description of a number of independent effects, including the calculation of activity coefficients that vary as much as 2 orders of magnitude over the conditions studied. The level of model accuracy attained was useful as a means of directing the experimental investigation and elucidating the performance-governing parameters. The model provides a useful tool  to investigate the effects of process variables and ultimately a powerful tool for process optimization.

Transmission electron microscopy shows a broad distribution of pore sizes with 100\u2013500\u00a0nm through-pores transecting a network of much smaller pores formed by aggregates of microgranules about 100\u00a0nm in size. Dextran standards, proteins, and virus-like particles (VLPs) show size-exclusion behavior consistent with such a bimodal distribution of pore sizes. For non-binding conditions, the trends in height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) as a function of mobile phase velocity and molecular size are consistent with perfusion suggesting that a fraction of the mobile phase between 0.0005 and 0.0008 flows through the particles. This small fraction provides little or no enhancement of intraparticle mass transfer for relatively small proteins (lysozyme and IgG) even at 1000\u00a0cm/h, but can contribute substantially to transport for large proteins (thyroglobulin) and VLPs. Intraparticle concentration profiles during transient adsorption are determined by confocal microscopy in batch and flow systems. The profiles are spherically symmetrical indicating a dominance of diffusion for smaller proteins in both batch and flow systems but become highly asymmetrical and skewed in the direction of flow for thyroglobulin at 1000\u00a0cm/h. Estimates of the convective enhancement of intraparticle transport for these conditions based on the confocal measurements are consistent with estimates of the intraparticle Peclet number and previously published models. Adsorption of VLPs, however, was found to be confined to a thin layer on the outer surface of the particles indicting that bound VLPs block access to the underlying pore network and suggesting that pores larger than those present on the resin studies are needed to take advantage of the effects of perfusion for the adsorption of large VLPs.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsPerfusion chromatographyMass transferProteinsVirus-like-particlesRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The gels were synthesized using 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid and (3-(methacryloylamino)propyl)trimethylammonium chloride monomers within fused silica capillaries with a square section. Partition coefficients were obtained by measuring the fluorescence intensity in the gel-filled capillaries equilibrated with dilute solutions of each probe. The partition coefficients show an exponential decay with gel concentration in agreement with the Ogston model for partitioning in fibrous gels. Comparison of the data for 10 kDa dextran with this model yields fiber radii of 0.79 and 0.99 nm for the anionic and the cationic gels, respectively, which are similar in magnitude to values reported in the literature for neutral polyacrylamide gels. Mesh sizes calculated on the basis of a single-pore-radius model vary between about 11 and about 6 nm for gels with gel concentrations between 0.1 and 0.26 g/cm3. Predictions of the dependence of the partition coefficient on the size of the solute based on the Ogston model are, however, only approximate. Better predictions are obtained with an empirical fit based on a model that considers the flexibility of the polymer chains. * \u2009To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Considerable work has been done on neutral gels (e.g. see Tanaka 1). However, much less is known about charged hydrogels, such as polyacrylamide-based materials, despite their widespread use. 2 Previous work has shown that oppositely charged macromolecules such as proteins are very favorably adsorbed in these gels at low ionic strengths. 2-5 On the other hand, uncharged macromolecules or macromolecules having the same charge as the gel are nearly completely excluded. 6 This suggests that these gels have a mesh size that is close to the size of these macromolecules so that nearly complete size exclusion prevails in the absence of a favorable electrostatic interaction. The diffusion behavior of oppositely charged macromolecules in these gels is also unusual. Macroscopic measurements have shown adsorption rates that are faster than could be obtained by molecular diffusion in the bulk liquid phase with an equivalent concentration driving force.3-5 Moreover, microscopic observations of diffusion patterns of colored and fluorescently labeled proteins in these gels have revealed that diffuse profiles are established and that the adsorbed protein molecules retain diffusional mobility within the gel. 7-10 It has been postulated that this behavior is due to the highly favorable but reversible partitioning of these molecules in the gel. Accordingly, protein molecules are thought to diffuse while continuously interacting with oppositely charged functional groups through a tight-fitting polymer mesh. In this conceptual transport model the high protein concentration in the gel gives rise to a large diffusional driving force, which, in turn, results in a high rate of mass transfer.8A measurement of the actual pore or mesh size of these gels is helpful in determining the validity of this conceptual model of transport as well as potential applications of these materials to broader ranges of molecules. Ordinary methods like mercury porosimetry or nitrogen adsorption are obviously not suitable for water-swollen gels. Thus, indirect methods such as quasielastic light scattering, tunneling electron microscopy of freeze-etched hydrogels, and electrophoretic mobility analysis have been used for these materials. 11-13 Unfortunately, however, the results appear to vary depending on the method used. For example, Park et al.12 obtained a mesh size of 5.5 nm for a neutral 5% cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogel with a 0.10 g/cm3 gel concentration using laser light scattering, while for the same gel Stellwagen13 obtained a mesh size of 21 nm using electrophoretic methods. Thus, methods where partitioning of macromolecules is measured directly are probably preferable if the goal is to determine the mesh size in relationship to size exclusion properties. Various approaches are available to describe partitioning of nonadsorbed solutes in gels. A widely used approach is based on the Ogston model 14 according to which the partition coefficient, K = q/C, defined by the  ratio of solute concentrations in the gel, q, and in solution, C, is given by where \u03c6 is the polymer volume fraction in the gel, rs is the solute radius, and rf is the radius of the polymer fibers. Tong and Anderson 15 found that protein partitioning in neutral polyacrylamide gels could be described by this equation using a fitted fiber radius of 0.65 nm. Different extensions of the basic Ogston model have also been proposed. Bosma and Wesselingh 16 have modified this model by assuming that the gel fibers can overlap, obtaining the following result: It can be seen that at low values of \u03c6 the difference between this equation and the original Ogston model vanishes. However, larger differences exist at high values of \u03c6 when fiber overlapping presumably becomes significant. Johansson and L\u00f6froth 17 derived a more general form of the model by including a scaling factor, \u03bd, to describe the fiber stiffness. The resulting equation, based on an empirical fit of Brownian dynamics simulations of hard spheres in polymer networks of wormlike chains, is Obviously, this equation reduces to the Ogston model when \u03bd = 2. Partitioning data for nonadsorbing macromolecules in charged polyacrylamide gels with defined gel concentrations are currently not available. Thus, in this work, we determine the partition coefficient of fluorescently labeled dextrans in anionic and cationic polyacrylamide gels as well as the partition coefficient of fluorescently labeled, negatively charged proteins in anionic gels for a range of polymer concentrations. In both cases, the probe molecules are not adsorbed. Two functional characteristics of the polymer gels are determined from these measurements:\u2009 the polymer fiber radius, rf, and the mesh size of the gels, \u03be. The former is determined for different gel concentrations by comparing the experimental partition coefficients to the Ogston model and its different extensions using the fiber radius as an adjustable parameter. The mesh size is obtained on the basis of a single-radius pore model, where the partition coefficient is dependent on the pore radius, rp, according to We assume that the mesh size is equal to twice the pore radius determined from this equation. It should be emphasized that this is merely a functional definition of mesh size and that it does not necessarily reflect the actual geometrical arrangement of polymer fibers in the gel. Materials and MethodsARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToPreparation of Gels. Optically clear, cationic and anionic gels were synthesized within the lumen of fused silica capillaries having a square section as described by Lewus and Carta7 and Russell et al.9 As in our previous work, 1 cm long sections of capillaries with 100 and 300 \u03bcm inside and outside dimensions (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) were stripped of their polymer coating and treated with Bind-Silane ((\u03b3-(methacryloxy)propyl)trimethoxysilane) from Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The treated capillaries were then filled with a solution containing a water-soluble functionalized acrylamido monomer, a cross-linker (N,N\u2018-methylenebisacrylamide, MBA), an initiator (ammonium persulfate, AP), and a promoter (N,N,N\u2018,N\u2018-tetramethylethylenediamine, TEMED). The monomer was (3-(methacryloylamino)propyl)trimethylammonium chloride (MAPTAC) for the cationic gels, and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS) for the anionic gels (Figure 1). Except for the anionic monomer, which was obtained from Lancaster (Pelham, NH), these chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).  Figure 1 Monomers used to prepare anionic and cationic gels:\u2009 (a) AMPS; (b) MAPTAC.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideGels with a polymer concentration of 0.16 g/cm3 and 5% cross-linking were prepared using 0.15 g of monomer, 0.0075 g of MBA, 0.0075 g of AP, and 1 \u03bcL of TEMED per cm3 of solution in distilled, deionized, degassed water. The corresponding charge density is 682 and 724 \u03bcmol/cm3 for the cationic and the anionic gel, respectively. Charged gels with gel concentrations of 0.10, 0.21, and 0.26 g/cm3 were prepared keeping the same proportions of the different components. Polymerization occurs rapidly after mixing and loading into the capillaries and is complete in less than an hour with a virtually complete incorporation of the monomer.9 Following polymerization, the gel-filled capillary sections were stored in a 10 mM, pH 6.5 Na2HPO4 buffer. An advantage of using gels synthesized within the constraints of these capillaries is that the gel volume remains constant. Thus, gel concentration and charge density are known precisely. Because of the covalent attachment to the capillary wall via the Bind-Silane, the capillary-supported gels are stable. Measurement of Partition Coefficients. Partition coefficients in the charged gels were determined using fluorescently labeled dextrans and proteins. Tetramethylrhodamine dextrans with molecular masses of 10, 40, and 70 kDa were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Unfortunately, these samples are not monodispersed. For example, according to the manufacturer, the 70 kDa dextran contains polymers with molecular masses in the range of 60\u221290 kDa. Our  measurements do not explicitly take into account the molecular weight distribution of these samples and thus have to be regarded as averages. The experiments were conducted with 0.05\u22122 mg/cm3 dextran solutions using greater concentrations for the larger dextrans in order to be able to obtain a consistent signal-to-noise ratio in the measurements of partitioning. The Stokes radii of the dextran probes were calculated from the empirical relationship of Oliver et al. 18 and are given in Table 1. It should be noted that theories for partitioning of linear, coiled polymers in fiber matrixes suggest that the radius of gyration may be a better measure of dextran partitioning. 19 Nonetheless, in this work we use the Stokes radius to define the size of the probe molecules since it has been suggested that globular proteins and dextrans are partitioned similarly for similar Stokes radii. 20 Since our intent is to characterize charged polyacrylamide gels used in protein chromatography applications, this approach seems appropriate for predicting partitioning of spherical solutes.20 Table 1.\u2009 Size of the Dextran Probes and Proteins Used in This Workprobers\u2009(nm) 10\u2009kDa\u2009dextran 2.7\u20091840\u2009kDa\u2009dextran 5.0\u20091870\u2009kDa\u2009dextran 6.3\u200918ovalbumin 2.8\u200925BSA 3.6\u200925Partitioning experiments were also performed for the anionic gels with ovalbumin (Mr \u223c 45\u2009000) labeled with rhodamine green and bovine serum albumin (BSA, Mr \u223c 65\u2009000) labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. The former was prepared as described by Russell and Carta,10 while the latter was obtained from Sigma. Solutions containing native and labeled protein (1 mg/cm3 total protein; degree of labeling, 68% for BSA and 15% for ovalbumin) were prepared in 10 mM sodium phosphate with 500 mM NaCl at a pH value of 6.5. Since the pI values of BSA and ovalbumin are 4.9 and 4.7, respectively, both proteins have a negative net charge at this pH. 21Partitioning experiments were conducted by placing the gel-filled capillaries in solutions for 1 or 2 days. After reaching equilibrium, the gels were placed on a glass slide under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Mod. Eclipse E200) at 100\u00d7 magnification, and the fluorescence intensity in the gel was measured as described by Russell and Carta.10 The fluorescent intensity of solution-filled capillaries was also measured and found to be linearly correlated to the solute concentration. ResultsARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToThe partition coefficient of 10 kDa dextran in different gels is shown in Figure 2. More extensive data were obtained for this size dextran since, due to its smaller size, it could be used to explore broader ranges of gel concentrations. Moreover, it is closer in size to the proteins used in this work. Partitioning is obviously a strong function of gel concentration but is similar for anionic and cationic gels at the same gel concentration. The specific volume of the polymer, \u03bdpol, is needed in order to evaluate the polymer volume fraction, \u03c6 = \u03bdpolCpol. Munk et al. 22 have reported a value \u03bdpol = 0.70 cm3/g for neutral polyacrylamide, but this value is not available for our charged gels. We thus measured the density of aqueous solutions of each monomer with a pycnometer and derived specific volumes of 0.69 and 0.87 cm3/g for AMPS and MAPTAC, respectively. We assume that these values can be taken as representative of the polymer density in the corresponding gels. Since the probe radius is known (see Table 1), rf can then be estimated from a least-squares fit of the data with the Ogston model. We obtain rf = 0.79 \u00b1 0.02 nm for the anionic gels and rf = 0.99 \u00b1 0.04 nm for the cationic gels. The larger rf value obtained for the cationic gel may be attributed to the bulkier trimethylammonium chloride pendant group (see Figure 1). The partition coefficient for the 10 kDa dextran was also determined for cationic gels with a gel concentration of 0.16 g/cm3 at a 400 mM ionic strength and was found to be 0.19 \u00b1 0.03. The corresponding rf value is 1.08 \u00b1 0.08 nm, which suggests that there is little dependence of partitioning on ionic strength in these constrained gels.  Figure 2 Partition coefficient of 10 kDa dextran in anionic and cationic polyacrylamide gels. Lines are fitted with the Ogston model.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe rf values determined for our charged gels are similar in magnitude to those obtained for neutral polyacrylamide gels by other authors by fitting with the Ogston model. For example, Ogston et al. 23 and Tong and Anderson15 obtained values of rf = 0.52 \u00b1 0.06 nm and rf = 0.65 nm, respectively, on the basis of protein partitioning in neutral cross-linked polyacrylamide gels, while Williams et al. 24 obtained rf values in the range of 0.75\u22120.86 nm, based on partitioning of dextrans. Farnan et al.6 also used the Ogston model to describe protein partitioning in Q-HyperD-F chromatography particles. These particles consist of large-pore silica beads filled with a cationic polyacrylamide gel reportedly similar to gels used in our work. These authors determined a fiber radius of 0.5 nm. However, the actual gel concentration in the Q-HyperD-F particles was not known and these authors' determination was based on an assumed polymer volume fraction of 0.05. The data in Figure 2 could also be fitted with the model of Bosma and Wesselingh.16 The rf values obtained in this case were 0.84 \u00b1 0.02 and 1.07 \u00b1 0.04 nm, for the anionic and cationic gels, respectively. These values are clearly not significantly different from those obtained with the Ogston model. Figure 3 shows the mesh size calculated from eq 4 with the single-pore-radius model in comparison with the estimates of Park et al.12 and Stellwagen13 for neutral polyacrylamide gels. Our values for charged gels are intermediate between the two. The differences can be ascribed in part to the different methods used.  Stellwagen determined the mesh size by observing the gel concentration where the electrophoretic mobility of a probe is reduced to half of the free solution value. Park et al., on the other hand, determined the mesh size using photon correlation spectroscopy. In any case, these results indicate that the mesh size of these gels is similar in magnitude to the size of typical globular proteins with diameters in the 6\u22128 nm range.  Figure 3 Mesh size calculated from Ogston model for anionic and cationic gels using 10 kDa dextran as a probe. Results for neutral polyacrylamide gels are from Park et al.12 and Stellwagen.13High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe results for partitioning of dextrans with different molecular masses and for partitioning of ovalbumin and BSA are shown in Table 2 for different anionic gels. The table also shows the predicted K-values based on the Ogston and Bosma and Wesselingh models using the parameters derived from the 10 kDa dextran results. It can be seen that the predictions are reasonable for the proteins but inaccurate for the larger dextrans with 40 and 70 kDa molecular masses. The dextran data were thus refitted with the Johansson and L\u00f6froth model (eq 3) using both rf and \u03bd as regressed parameters. The corresponding fitted values are rf = 0.30 \u00b1 0.05 nm and \u03bd = 1.29 \u00b1 0.08. A parity plot comparing experimental and calculated values is shown in Figure 4, and values of K are shown in Table 2. The maximum relative error is around 50% for the 40 kDa dextran and is much smaller for the other probes.

The polymer fiber radii estimated on the basis of the Ogston model from the 10 kDa dextran partitioning are around 0.7 nm for the anionic gels and around 0.9 nm for the cationic gels. These values are similar to those estimated for neutral polyacrylamide gels with the same degree of cross-linking. The mesh size in these charged gels varies between about 11 and about 6 nm for gel concentrations in the range of 0.1\u22120.26 mg/cm3. Similar values are obtained using the model of Bosma and Wesselingh. However, the K-values predicted by both the Ogston and the Bosma and Wesselingh models are consistently lower than the experimental ones for the larger probes, suggesting that the charged polymer gels are actually capable of accommodating larger solutes than expected. Both of these models assume that the polymer chains are rigid. On the other hand, the Johansson and L\u00f6froth model could describe approximately both the dependence on \u03c6 and the dependence on solute size. This model takes into account the flexibility of the polymer chains through the scaling parameter \u03bd. It appears that accounting for the flexibility of the polymer chains may have to be taken into account in order to predict the effect of probe size on partitioning, especially when the size of the probe approaches the gel mesh size. The partition coefficients for the proteins are somewhat overestimated by the model. This could result from the inherent difficulty of predicting the partitioning of charged globular molecules from the behavior of the neutral dextrans. Nonetheless, despite the quantitative uncertainties, an important conclusion can be reached regarding the implications of the small mesh sizes obtained for our charged polyacrylamide gels on protein adsorption rates. Previous work had hypothesized that mass transfer of oppositely charged proteins in these gels occurs through a tight-fitting polymer network with the protein molecules continuously interacting with multiple charged functional groups as they diffuse through the gel matrix. According to this hypothesis, high rates of mass transfer are obtained because of the large driving force for diffusion afforded by the high protein concentration in the gel. For example, Russell and Carta9 observed adsorption rates of negatively charged myglobin (rs \u223c 2 nm) in a 0.21 g/cm3 cationic gel that were 20\u221230 times faster than could be obtained by diffusion in a free solution with the same concentration gradient driving force. On the basis of the results of the present work, this gel has a mesh size of about 7 nm, which is less than double the diameter of the  diffusing protein. Accordingly, diffusion is expected to be highly hindered in this gel, and indeed we found9 the diffusion coefficient of myoglobin in this gel to be about 8 \u00d7 10-8 cm2/s or only about 1/13th of its free solution diffusivity. 25 On the other hand, the rate of adsorption depends on the product of the diffusion coefficient and the driving force. For this system, the diffusion coefficient is small because of the small mesh size, but the driving force is very large because of the very favorable partitioning of myoglobin in this cationic gel at low ionic strengths (K \u223c 300 at 1 mg/cm3 protein concentration in 50 mM Tris buffer9). As a final result the rate of adsorption is large. Similar results have been found for other proteins in anionic polyacrylamide gels8 and for commercial chromatography particles incorporating similar gels.3-6Author InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAuthorsShawn M.

(K) and diffusion coeff. (Dgel) of 2 proteins and 2 linear polymers were measured as a function of polymer content of a 2.7% cross-linked polyacrylamide (PA) gel.  The gel concn., expressed as a vol. percentage of PA in the gel (.vphi.), varied between 0-14%.  The measurements were made by fluorescence spectroscopy; fluorescent dyes were covalently attached to the macromols.  The dependence of K on .vphi. for the proteins agrees with a model of the gel network as randomly placed, impenetrable rods.  The diffusion data are interpreted in terms of an effective medium theory for the mobility of a sphere in a Brinkman fluid.  Using values of the Brinkman parameter in the literature, the effective medium model with no adjustable parameters fits the diffusion data for the proteins very well but under predicts Dgel for the linear polymers.  The gel effect on partitioning is significantly greater than that on diffusion.  The permeability (KDgel) of bovine serum albumin decreased by 103 over the range .vphi. = 0\u21928%, and the ratio of permeabilities for RNase compared to BSA increased from 2-30. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28XitVOgt74%253D&md5=26744ec6900d7141a6579f662bb9a5d316Bosma, J.

To examine the differences between these macromols. in vivo, the fractional clearances of titrated Ficoll and dextran were measured over a wide range of mol. sizes (Stokes-Einstein radius, rs, from 19 to 65 \u00c5) in normal euvolemic Munich-Wistar rats.  Whole-kidney and single-nephron hemodynamic conditions were characterized through a combination of clearance and micropuncture measurements.  The fractional clearance, or sieving coeff. (\u03b8), for dextran significantly exceeded that of Ficoll at all mol. sizes examd., \u03b8 for dextran being \u223c10 times that for Ficoll for rs > 30 \u00c5.  Thus, the results with Ficoll imply a more size-restrictive barrier than do the results with dextran.  The values of \u03b8 for Ficoll approximated previously reported values for uncharged globular proteins.  Although \u03b8 for Ficoll at rs = 35 \u00c5 was much smaller than the corresponding value for dextran, it was still \u223c30 times greater than typical values of the filtrate-to-plasma concn. ratio reported for serum albumin (a polyanion) in the rat, in agreement with the concept that glomerular charge-selectivity normally plays an important role in the prevention of albuminuria.  Three membrane-pore models were compared in their ability to represent the dextran and Ficoll sieving data.  A lognormal pore-size distribution in parallel with a nonselective shunt pathway was more effective than either an isoporous membrane with a shunt or a purely lognormal distribution.  On the basis of these lab. results and computations, Ficoll may be preferred over dextran in future studies of glomerular size-selectivity. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK38XmtVygsL0%253D&md5=86956b1fdfb2f44cbf2d68e3f526829a19White, J.

The gel concn., expressed as a vol. percentage of PA in the gel (.vphi.), varied between 0-14%.  The measurements were made by fluorescence spectroscopy; fluorescent dyes were covalently attached to the macromols.  The dependence of K on .vphi. for the proteins agrees with a model of the gel network as randomly placed, impenetrable rods.  The diffusion data are interpreted in terms of an effective medium theory for the mobility of a sphere in a Brinkman fluid.  Using values of the Brinkman parameter in the literature, the effective medium model with no adjustable parameters fits the diffusion data for the proteins very well but under predicts Dgel for the linear polymers.  The gel effect on partitioning is significantly greater than that on diffusion.  The permeability (KDgel) of bovine serum albumin decreased by 103 over the range .vphi. = 0\u21928%, and the ratio of permeabilities for RNase compared to BSA increased from 2-30. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28XitVOgt74%253D&md5=26744ec6900d7141a6579f662bb9a5d316Bosma, J.

To examine the differences between these macromols. in vivo, the fractional clearances of titrated Ficoll and dextran were measured over a wide range of mol. sizes (Stokes-Einstein radius, rs, from 19 to 65 \u00c5) in normal euvolemic Munich-Wistar rats.  Whole-kidney and single-nephron hemodynamic conditions were characterized through a combination of clearance and micropuncture measurements.  The fractional clearance, or sieving coeff. (\u03b8), for dextran significantly exceeded that of Ficoll at all mol. sizes examd., \u03b8 for dextran being \u223c10 times that for Ficoll for rs > 30 \u00c5.  Thus, the results with Ficoll imply a more size-restrictive barrier than do the results with dextran.  The values of \u03b8 for Ficoll approximated previously reported values for uncharged globular proteins.  Although \u03b8 for Ficoll at rs = 35 \u00c5 was much smaller than the corresponding value for dextran, it was still \u223c30 times greater than typical values of the filtrate-to-plasma concn. ratio reported for serum albumin (a polyanion) in the rat, in agreement with the concept that glomerular charge-selectivity normally plays an important role in the prevention of albuminuria.  Three membrane-pore models were compared in their ability to represent the dextran and Ficoll sieving data.  A lognormal pore-size distribution in parallel with a nonselective shunt pathway was more effective than either an isoporous membrane with a shunt or a purely lognormal distribution.  On the basis of these lab. results and computations, Ficoll may be preferred over dextran in future studies of glomerular size-selectivity. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK38XmtVygsL0%253D&md5=86956b1fdfb2f44cbf2d68e3f526829a19White, J.

In both resins, the ligand contains a phenyl group, a carboxyl group, and a peptide bond but with a different arrangement. Transmission electron microscopy and inverse size exclusion chromatography indicate a bimodal distribution of pores in Nuvia cPrime, including small pores with 10\u00a0nm radius and pores larger than 400\u00a0nm, and a monodispersed distribution of pores in Capto MMC, averaging 32\u00a0nm in radius. Potentiometric titration curves show similar buffering ranges and pK\n\na\n values for the ligands in both resins and a slightly higher ligand density for Nuvia cPrime. Equilibrium binding capacities for lysozyme and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) are also similar for both resins at comparable pH and salt concentrations, although Capto MMC shows a weaker dependence on salt concentration as a result of its more hydrophobic character. The main difference is the adsorption kinetics of the mAb, which is the larger of the two proteins studied. For both resins, as shown by means of confocal laser scanning miscopy, the adsorption kinetics is controlled by pore diffusion. Capto MMC with its smaller pores has a slower rate of mass transfer than Nuvia cPrime. As a result, for the mAb, much higher column dynamic binding capacities are obtained for Nuvia cPrime than for Capto MMC.\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Gordon Library, WPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductionMultimodal or mixed mode chromatography (MMC) utilizes stationary phases that are functionalized with ligands containing multiple chemical moieties providing complementary interactions to adsorb and separate proteins (Zhao et al. 2009; Nfor et al. 2010; Yang and Geng 2011; Kallberg et al. 2012). Most commonly, MMC media involve an ion exchange group, which provides electrostatic interactions, and a hydrophobic group, which provides binding via van der Waals\u2019 forces (Gao et al. 2008, Nfor et al. 2010). Combining these interactions has been shown to provide high selectivity for various separations (Chung et al. 2010a, b; Hou and Cramer 2011) as well strong binding even at relatively high salt concentrations or \u201csalt-tolerance\u201d allowing use of MMC to capture proteins from a high salt feedstock without having to dilute or buffer exchange the feed (Schwartz et al. 2001).As noted by several authors (e.g. Hou and Cramer 2011; Holstein et al. 2012a, b; Hirano et al. 2014; Kaleas et al. 2014), the combined interactions make MMC dependent in a complex way on several process variable including pH, salt concentration, temperature, and the presence of mobile phase additives, such as arginine (Gao et al. 2007; Kallberg et al. 2011; Hirano et al. 2014). As a result, developing processes based on MMC usually requires extensive experimentation (Pezzini et al. 2011; Kaleas et al. 2014). A better understanding of both protein\u2013ligand interactions and of transport mechanism in MMC is thus desirable in order to develop more rational approaches to process development.Protein adsorption equilibria on MMC resins have been studied for proteins of relatively small molar mass (e.g. ubiquitin, lysozyme, and BSA) (Gao et al. 2006a, b; Nfor et al. 2010; Chung et al. 2010a, b; Holstein et al. 2012a, b; Srinivasan et al. 2014) by NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry and simulation. Adsorption isotherm models taking salt concentration and pH into account have also been proposed both based on the Langmuir isotherm by Gao et al. (2006a, b) and based on a thermodynamic framework by Nfor et al. (2010). Protein adsorption kinetics on MMC resins have also been studied for model proteins in cationic MMC resins. Zhao et al. (2008) obtained the effective diffusivity of BSA in experimental resins and reported that the diffusivity decreased with salt concentration. Gao et al. (2006a, b) reported instead that, for a different experimental resin, the effective diffusivity had a maximum at a moderate salt concentration. Yu et al. (2011) studied the uptake rate of \u03b3-globulin on dextran-grafted resins functionalized either with a cationic ligand or with a cationic mixed-mode ligand. While intraparticle protein transport was fast for the cationic ligand, presumably because of a surface diffusion contribution to transport, slower rates were observed for the MMC ligand, indicating the protein transport is hindered by the stronger binding that results from multiple interactions.This work has two main objectives. The first is to understand the effects of resin structure and ligand chemistry on protein adsorption equilibrium and kinetics both for lysozyme, which is a relatively small protein, and for a monoclonal antibody (mAb), which is a relatively large protein. Two commercial resins are used for this study, one based on a polymeric backbone, containing relatively large pores, and the other based on an agarose backbone, containing relatively small pores. The ligands in these resins contain essentially the same chemical moieties, but their arrangement is different potentially resulting in different interactions with adsorbed protein. The second objective is to elucidate the intraparticle transport mechanism of both proteins by examining their movement within the resin particles during transient adsorption using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).Materials and methodsMaterialsThe resins used in this work are Nuvia cPrime from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA), which is based on a hydrophilic polymeric matrix, and Capto MMC from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA), which is agarose-based. Both resins are in spherical form and mean particle diameters, determined by optical microscopy, are 69 and 85\u00a0\u03bcm for Nuvia cPrime and Capto MMC, respectively. The ligand in each resin is shown in Fig.\u00a01, as reported by the respective manufacturers. In both cases, the ligand contains a phenyl group, a peptide bond, and a carboxyl group but the arrangement of these moieties is different in the two ligands resulting in a different presentation of hydrophobic and charged groups to the adsorbate molecules. The cPrime ligand is tethered to the resin (R) via a secondary amine group while the MMC ligand is tethered via a thio-ether.Fig.\u00a01Multimodal ligands in a Nuvia cPrime and b Capto MMC according to the respective manufacturerFull size image\nThe proteins used in this work are lysozyme (Lyo), with molar mass ~15\u00a0kDa and pI\u00a0~\u00a011, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) with molar mass ~150\u00a0kDa and pI 8.2, available in our laboratory. The hydrodynamic radii, r\n\nh\n, of these two proteins are approximately 2 and 5\u00a0nm, respectively, as determined from the Stokes\u2013Einstein equation based on their respective aqueous diffusivities D\n0\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 and 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0cm2/s obtained from Tyn and Gusek (1990). Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Fisher Scientific (Pittsburg, PA, USA). Experiments at pH 5 or below were conducted in 20\u00a0mM sodium acetate buffers while experiments at higher pH values were conducted in 20\u00a0mM sodium phosphate. All experiments were conducted at room temperature, 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C.MethodsResin physical and chemical propertiesTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine each resin\u2019s backbone structure and inverse size exclusion chromatography (iSEC) was used to determine resin porosity and apparent pore size. Resin samples for TEM were prepared by first saturating them with 1\u00a0mg/mL lysozyme at pH 5 and fixing them with 2\u00a0% glutaraldehyde, dehydrating them in an ethanol gradient from 0 to 100\u00a0% anhydrous ethanol, and finally embedding them into LR-White resin (London Resin Company, London, UK) as described in P\u00e9rez Almod\u00f3var et al. (2011). After embedding, 80\u00a0nm slices were prepared using an ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed with a JEOL 100 CX transmission electron microscope. The bound lysozyme readily takes up the heavy metal stains, enhancing contrast and resolution compared to lysozyme-free samples.For iSEC, each resin was packed into a 6.6\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0140\u00a0mm Omnifit column (Diba Industries Inc., Danbury, CT, USA). Glucose and dextrans, obtained from Spectrum Chemical MFG Co. (Cardena, CA, USA), with molecular masses of 4, 10, 40, and 70\u00a0kDa, and thyroglobulin, obtained from Sigma-Adrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) with molecular mass of 700\u00a0kDa, were used as size standards according to the procedure described in Stone and Carta (2007) at pH 7.5 for thyroglobulin and pH 6.5 for other size standards. Thyroglobulin, which has a pI of 4.6 (Heidelberger and Pedersen 1935) was found to be un-adsorbed by either resin at pH 7.5. Pressure-flow curves, obtained at superficial velocities from 150 to 1000\u00a0cm/h, were linear for these columns and were used in conjunction with the Blake-Kozeny equation (Bird et al. 1960) to determine the extraparticle porosity values (\u03b5) of each column, which were 0.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 and 0.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 for Nuvia cPrime and Capto MMC columns, respectively.Potentiometric titrations were performed as described in Pabst and Carta (2007) to determine the pK\n\na\n value of each ligand. For this purpose, each resin was first packed into a 5\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0mm Tricorn column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and equilibrated with 10\u00a0mM HCl solutions (pH\u00a0~\u00a02) containing 20, 50, and 100\u00a0mM NaCl. At this pH, all carboxyl groups in either ligand are expected to be protonated. The resin samples were then extruded from the column into 25\u00a0mL of the equilibration solution and titrated with standardized sodium hydroxide while monitoring pH with a glass-combination electrode. Blank titrations without the resin were also conducted at each solution concentration and the results were subtracted from the resin titration curves.Protein adsorption propertiesEquilibrium isothermsEquilibrium isotherms were obtained at pH 3, 5, and 7 for lysozyme and pH 4, 5, and 6 for the mAb over a range of NaCl concentrations. Higher pH values were not used for the mAb since little or no binding was observed at pH\u00a0>\u00a06, except at very low salt concentrations. For this purpose, resin samples were first equilibrated in the working buffer and then centrifuged at 5000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min in a microcentrifuge filter tube (Eppendorf MiniSpin Centrifuge 5702) to remove extraparticle solution. Weighed amounts of each centrifuged resin were then added to plastic tubes containing 1.5\u00a0mL of solutions with different initial protein concentrations in same buffer. The amount of resin added to each tube was estimated to provide a roughly 50\u00a0% change in protein concentration at equilibrium. After rotating the tubes end-over-end at a few rpm for 24\u00a0h, the supernatant protein concentration was measured with a NanoVue spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) at 280\u00a0nm and the adsorbed protein concentration calculated by mass balance. Hydrated particle densities of 1.08\u00a0mg/mL for Nuvia cPrime and 1.13\u00a0mg/mL for Capto MMC, determined with a pycnometer, were used to express the protein bound in terms of adsorbed mass per unit volume of resin particle.Adsorption kineticsProtein adsorption kinetics were studied using batch uptake measurements, which provide information about the rates, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which also provides information about the dominant transport mechanism. Batch uptake measurements were conducted as described in Carta et al. (2005). Briefly, a sample of centrifuged resin was added to a solution containing 1\u00a0mg/mL protein in a glass vessel agitated with a paddle stirrer while continuously recirculating the solution through a filter and a UV detector connected to a data acquisition system. The amount of resin added was again estimated to give a roughly 50\u00a0% change in the supernatant protein concentration. The amount of protein bound as a function of time was obtained by material balance using the UV readings at 280\u00a0nm.CLSM imaging was conducted as described by P\u00e9rez Almod\u00f3var et al. (2011, 2012). For this purpose, the mAb was conjugated with the amine-reactive fluorescent dye Rhodamine Green\u2122, obtained from Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in Zhu and Carta (2014). The experiments were conducted as follows. A sample of the resin was added to a plastic tube and mixed, by rotating the tube end-over-end at a few rpm, with 10\u00a0mL of a solution containing 1\u00a0mg/mL of the unlabeled protein admixed with the conjugated protein in a 1/40 conjugated to unconjugated protein molar ratio. At periodic time intervals, a small amount of the suspension was pipetted out of the tube and rapidly processed in a microcentrifuge filter to separate the particles from solution. The Capto MMC particles, which are fairly transparent, were imaged directly by placing them in a drop of buffer on a microscope slide. The Nuvia cPrime particle, which are relatively opaque, were instead placed in a drop of buffered 50\u00a0% (w/w) sucrose as refractive index matching fluid (P\u00e9rez Almod\u00f3var et al. 2011, 2012). All sample processing after collection was done rapidly (less than 1\u00a0min) in order to minimize any changes in the bound protein. A Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.4 NA oil objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, LLC, Thornwood, NY, USA) was used to obtain equatorial image of the intraparticle fluorescence.Column breakthrough experiments were conducted by packing each resin into a 5\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0mm Tricorn column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to a height of about 5\u00a0cm and providing a 1.9\u00a0mg/mL protein feed with an AKTA Explorer 10 unit. Based on pressure drop\u00a0measurements, the extraparticle porosities of these columns were 0.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 and 0.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 for Nuvia cPrime and Capto MMC columns, respectively. Flow rates were 1\u00a0mL/min, corresponding to a residence time of approximately 1\u00a0min, for runs with lysozyme and 0.5\u00a0mL/min, corresponding to a residence time of approximately 2\u00a0min, for runs with the mAb. In each case, the effluent protein concentration was determined by UV at 280\u00a0nm.Results and discussionResin structure and chemistryFigure\u00a02 shows representative TEM images of the two resins. Both of the images shown correspond to areas near the outer edge of each particle, but similar features were also seen throughout each particle\u2019s interior. In both images, the lighter grey area is the embedding LRWhite resin, while the darker features are the resin matrix. As seen in Fig.\u00a02a, Nuvia cPrime has a microgranular structure that defines a network of relatively large macropores, up to about 500\u00a0nm in size and similar to the structure reported for other Nuvia matrices, such as the strong cation exchanger Nuvia HR-S, which is based on the same backbone (Reck et al. 2015). On the other hand, as seen in Fig.\u00a02b, Capto MMC has a fibrous structure, typical of agarose matrices, which defines a network of smaller pores, most of which appear to be smaller than 100\u00a0nm.Fig.\u00a02TEM images of a Nuvia cPrime at 15\u00a0k magnification and b Capto MMC at 20\u00a0k magnification. Note the different scales for the two imagesFull size image\nFigure\u00a03 shows the results of the iSEC experiments expressed as \\(K_{D} = {{\\left( {{{V_{R} } \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{V_{R} } {V_{C} - \\varepsilon }}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {V_{C} - \\varepsilon }}} \\right)} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{\\left( {{{V_{R} } \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{V_{R} } {V_{C} - \\varepsilon }}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {V_{C} - \\varepsilon }}} \\right)} {\\left( {1 - \\varepsilon } \\right)}}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {\\left( {1 - \\varepsilon } \\right)}}\\) versus the probe radius, r\n\nh\n, where V\n\nR\n is the retention volume at peak maximum of each of the size standards and V\n\nC\n is the column volume. The Capto MMC data could be fitted using the following equation:$$K_{D} = \\varepsilon_{p} \\left( {1 - \\frac{{r_{h} }}{{r_{pore} }}} \\right)^{2}$$\n                    (1)\n                where \\(\\varepsilon_{p}\\) is the intraparticle porosity and r\n\npore\n is the pore radius, which assumes a monodispersed distribution of cylindrical pores (Hagel et al. 1996). The Nuvia cPrime data, on the other hand, which could not be described by Eq.\u00a01, were fitted according to:$$K_{D} = \\varepsilon_{p,m} \\left( {1 - \\frac{{r_{h} }}{{r_{pore,m} }}} \\right)^{2} + \\varepsilon_{p,M} \\left( {1 - \\frac{{r_{h} }}{{r_{pore,M} }}} \\right)^{2}$$\n                    (2)\n                which assumes a bidispersed distribution of small cylindrical pore with radius r\n\npore,m\n, referred to as \u201cmicropores\u201d, and larger cylindrical pores with radius r\n\npore,M\n, referred to as \u201cmacropores\u201d (Yao and Lenhoff 2004; Wu et al. 2013). In this equation, \\(\\varepsilon_{p,m}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{p,M}\\) are the intraparticle porosities associated with small and large pores, respectively; the total porosity is \\(\\varepsilon_{p} = \\varepsilon_{p,m} + \\varepsilon_{p,M}\\). The parameter values obtained by regressing these two equations to the data are summarized in Table\u00a01. As seen from this table, while the total porosity is similar for the two materials, a large portion of the Nuvia cPrime porosity is associated with very large pores, while all the porosity in Capto MMC is associated with relatively small pores.Fig.\u00a03iSEC results showing each probe K\n\nD\n-values versus its hydrodynamic radius. Lines are based on Eq.\u00a01 for Capto MMC and Eq.\u00a02 for Nuvia cPrime using the parameters in Table\u00a01\nFull size image\nTable\u00a01 Physical and chemical properties of the resins used in this workFull size table\nFigure\u00a04 shows the potentiometric titration curves at three different NaCl concentrations. Both resins have buffering capacity in the pH range between 4 and 7. At higher pH values, Capto MMC reaches a distinct plateau, corresponding to complete deprotonation of the carboxyl group in the ligand (Fig.\u00a04b). The behavior of Nuvia cPrime is similar to that of Capto MMC between pH 2 and 7, except that the curves continue to rise, albeit slowly, at higher pH values. This continued increase is attributed to the presence of a small concentration of weak base groups, which, according to the resin manufacturer, are associated with the resin backbone. Based on the titration curves, the pK\n\na\n of these groups is around 8 and their concentration is around 0.02\u00a0mmol/mL of particle. The following equation can be used to model the data in Fig.\u00a04 over the entire pH range for Capto MMC and for pH values up to about 7 for Nuvia cPrime (Pabst and Carta 2007):$$q_{{Na^{ + } }}^{{\\prime }} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ { - \\frac{{K_{a} C_{{Na^{ + } }} }}{{C_{{H^{ + } }} }} + \\sqrt {\\left( {\\frac{{K_{a} C_{{Na^{ + } }} }}{{C_{{H^{ + } }} }}} \\right)^{2} + 4q_{C}^{{\\prime }} \\frac{{K_{a} C_{{Na^{ + } }} }}{{C_{{H^{ + } }} }}} } \\right]$$\n                    (3)\n                where \\(q_{{Na^{ + } }}^{{\\prime }} = q_{{COO^{ - } }}^{{\\prime }}\\) and \\(q_{C}^{{\\prime }}\\) are the concentration of deprotonated carboxyl groups in the resin at a given pH and the total carboxyl group concentration, respectively, expressed as mmol per mL of resin solid. The corresponding q-value expressed as mmol per mL of particle volume are found by dividing the q\u2032-values by the quantity 1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\\(\\varepsilon_{p}\\), where \\(\\varepsilon_{p}\\) is the intraparticle porosity. As shown by Helfferich (1962), this equation is based on a Donnan equilibrium allowing a description of the effects on salt concentration on the titration curve with a single pKa-value for the carboxyl groups. The parameter values obtained by fitting this equation to the data are given in Table\u00a01 which shows that the pK\n\na\n-values of the two ligands are very similar. Nuvia cPrime has, however, a somewhat higher ligand density when expressed per unit particle volume.Fig.\u00a04Potentiometric titrations of a Nuvia cPrime and b Capto MMC with different concentrations of NaCl. Lines are calculated from Eq.\u00a03 with parameters in Table\u00a01\nFull size image\nProtein adsorption propertiesAdsorption isothermsFigures\u00a05 and 6 show the adsorption isotherms for both resins obtained at different salt concentration and pH for lysozyme and the mAb. Lines are based on the Langmuir isotherm, \\(q = {{q_{m} K_{L} C} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{q_{m} K_{L} C} {\\left( {1 + K_{L} C} \\right)}}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {\\left( {1 + K_{L} C} \\right)}}\\), with the regressed parameters summarized in Tables\u00a02 and 3. As expected, because of the multimodal nature of the ligands, both salt concentration and pH affect the adsorption isotherm. The trends are similar for both resins and for both proteins. At low pH, the amount of protein bound is relatively insensitive to the salt concentration and actually increases somewhat as the salt concentration increases indicating that hydrophobic interactions are dominant. As shown in Fig.\u00a04, at pH values between 2 and 4, both ligands are nearly completely protonated so that electrostatic interactions between protein and ligand are negligible. At the higher pH values (pH 7 for lysozyme and pH 6 for the mAb), protein binding becomes a strong function of salt concentration, decreasing rapidly as the Na+ concentration increases. This effect is more pronounced for the mAb, which appears to be a weaker binder compared to lysozyme. At these higher pH values, electrostatic interactions between the protein molecules (which are positively charged) and both ligands, which are nearly completely deprotonated and, hence, negatively charged, are dominant. Even so, however, significant binding occurs for lysozyme even in 400\u00a0mM NaCl indicating that hydrophobic interactions between the protein and the ligand still contribute to binding. This effect, often referred to as \u201csalt tolerance\u201d, is more pronounced for Capto MMC, which is consistent with the apparently more favorable presentation of the hydrophobic moiety of the ligand to the adsorbed protein molecules for Capto MMC compared to Nuvia cPrime. As seen in Fig.\u00a06, however, the salt tolerance effect is protein dependent and is much less significant for the mAb at pH 6. At the intermediate pH of 5, when both ligands are partially deprotonated (see Fig.\u00a04), hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions appear to work cooperatively resulting in a relative high protein binding capacity and greater salt tolerance especially for lysozyme, for which the binding capacity is virtually independent of salt concentration, but also, although to a lesser extent, for the mAb. At pH 7, which is fairly close to the pI of the mAb (~ 8.2), little or no mAb adsorption was observed for Nuvia cPrime, while adsorption on Capto MMC was only observed without any added NaCl (data not shown for brevity). At this pH, binding of this mAb is thus very weak despite the presence of the hydrophobic moiety in the Capto MMC ligand.Fig.\u00a05Adsorption isotherms for lysozyme as a function of pH and NaCl concentration in buffers containing 20\u00a0mM Na+.

Additional results (not shown for brevity) were obtained at pH 5 with the addition of 200 and 400\u00a0mM NaCl. An apparent effective pore diffusivity, D\n\ne\n, was obtained in each case by fitting the analytical solution of the pore diffusion model for a rectangular isotherm taking into account the particle size distribution (Eqs.\u00a033\u201334 in Carta and Ubiera (2003)). The assumption of a rectangular isotherm is reasonable given the favorable nature of the adsorption isotherms. The fitted D\n\ne\n-values are summarized in Table\u00a04 along with the values D\n\ne\n\n/D\n0 normalized by each protein\u2019s aqueous diffusivity. In the case of lysozyme, the D\n\ne\n-values are relatively independent of NaCl concentration and similar in magnitude for both resins. Different results are, however, obtained for the mAb. In the case of Nuvia cPrime, the D\n\ne\n-value, although smaller than those obtained for lysozyme, are again relatively independent of conditions. Moreover, the D\n\ne\n\n/D\n0-values are comparable to the lysozyme values indicating that, despite their roughly threefold difference in size, both proteins experience similar hindrance. This is a result of the large macropore size of Nuvia cPrime, which allows relatively unhindered diffusion of both proteins. The results for Capto MMC show a trend of increasing D\n\ne\n with increasing salt concentration at pH 5 and with increasing pH. With no added NaCl, when mAb binding is strongest, the D\n\ne\n-values are much smaller than the value obtained for Nuvia cPrime under the same conditions. This appears to be a result of the much smaller pore size of Capto MMC, which results in much greater diffusional hindrance for the larger mAb molecules. Diffusional hindrance increases in these small pores when more protein is bound, which, in turn, is likely to result in further reduction of the apparent pore size. At higher salt concentrations, when less protein is bound (see Fig.\u00a06) the D\n\ne\n-values for Capto MMC increase. This effect is likely due to less diffusional hindrance although surface diffusion, made possible by the lower protein binding strength and, hence, great surface diffusivity, can also be an additional contribution to transport for these conditions.Fig.\u00a07Batch uptake curves for a lysozyme and b the mAb in buffers containing 20\u00a0mM Na+.

At pH 5 and 6, when protein binding is strongest, resin beads exhibit a very sharp adsorption front. The nature of this front is consistent with a pore diffusion mechanism with a rectangular isotherm and without kinetic resistance to binding. While the transport mechanism appears to be the same for both resins, the front moves much faster toward the center of the particles for Nuvia cPrime compared to Capto MMC (Fig.\u00a09), consistent with the much higher effective pore diffusivity for Nuvia cPrime obtained from the batch uptake experiments. According to the classical shrinking core model, the position of the adsorption front in the particle is described by the following equation (Ruthven 1984):$$2\\rho_{s}^{3} - 3\\rho^{2}_{s} + 1 = \\frac{{6D_{0} Ct}}{{q_{m} r_{p}^{2} }}\\frac{{D_{e} }}{{D_{0} }}$$\n                    (4)\n                where \\(\\rho_{s} = {{r_{s} } \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{r_{s} } {r_{p} }}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} {r_{p} }}\\) is the dimensionless position of the adsorption front. Figure\u00a010 shows plots of this quantity obtained from graphical measurements of the position of the adsorption front for a large number of different particles collected at different times for both Nuvia cPrime and Capto MMC. The lines in both plots are based on Eq.\u00a04 fitted to the data. In the case of Nuvia cPrime, the data at both pH 5 and 6 conform well to the model. The corresponding D\n\ne\n-values, shown in Table\u00a04, are in fact very similar to those obtained from the batch uptake experiments, with a maximum deviation of about 20\u00a0%, confirming the pore-diffusion limited kinetics. On the other hand, in the case of Capto MMC, we noted a substantial heterogeneity in the kinetic behavior of different particles from the same experiment, which resulted in a high degree of scatter in Fig.\u00a010b, especially at pH 5. In this case, while in some particles the adsorption front moved relatively quickly and reached the center of the beads, in others the adsorption front made only very modest headway into the particle even at long times. Figure\u00a011 shows a few examples of this behavior, which appears to be related to either blocking of the pores by the bound protein or, perhaps, by a heterogeneous distribution of ligands within some beads. Due to the higher binding capacity and stronger binding at pH 5, the diffusional hindrance and pore blockage caused by the bound protein are likely to be greater making the effect more pronounced than at pH 6. This effect is also reflected in the greater scatter in Fig.\u00a010b at pH 5 since each point represents a measurement for an individual particle and the heterogeneous distribution of adsorption kinetics seems broader at this pH. On the average, however, as shown in Table\u00a04, the D\n\ne\n-values determined by fitting Eq.\u00a04 to the entire Capto MMC dataset including a large number of beads are in relatively good agreement with those obtained from the batch uptake experiments indicating that these values can be used as a practical description of protein binding kinetics in this resin.Fig.\u00a08CLSM images of 1\u00a0mg/mL mAb adsorption on Nuvia cPrime particles in buffers containing 20\u00a0mM Na+ at a pH 5 and b pH 6.

All data are at pH 5 with no added NaCl. For these conditions, in the case of lysozyme both equilibrium and dynamic binding capacities (DBC) are similar. Very different results are obtained, however, for the mAb. While the equilibrium binding is somewhat higher for Capto MMC compared to Nuvia cPrime, (see Fig.\u00a05c, d), the adsorption kinetics are much faster in Nuvia cPrime resulting in a much sharper breakthrough curve and in a substantial DBC at 10\u00a0% of breakthrough. In the case of Capto MMC, mass transfer is very slow as a result of the large diffusional hindrance. The net effect is that, in this case, the breakthrough curve is very shallow with early breakthrough. The lines shown in Fig.\u00a012 are calculated according to the analytical solutions of the pore diffusion model with a rectangular isotherm, neglecting boundary layer resistance and axial dispersion, which are given by Cooper and Liberman (1970). For both lysozyme and the mAb on Nuvia cPrime and for lysozyme on Capto MMC, mass transfer is sufficiently fast that at the residence times used, that the mass transfer zone is fully developed and, thus, the simpler constant pattern solution (Eq.\u00a024 in Cooper and Liberman) could be used to predict the breakthrough curve. On the other hand, for the mAb on Capto MMC mass transfer is too slow to attain a constant pattern with a 2-min residence time, which required use of the general, non-constant pattern solution (Eqs.\u00a010, 20, and 27 in Cooper and Liberman) to predict the breakthrough curve. In either case, the analytical solution was fitted to the experimental breakthrough curves by adjusting the D\n\ne\n-value and the best-fit values are given in Table\u00a04. As seen in this table, the D\n\ne\n-values that match the breakthrough curves are consistent with those obtained from the batch uptake and confocal experiments confirming the validity of the model assumptions and the ability to predict column behavior.Fig.\u00a012Breakthrough curves for a lysozyme at 1\u00a0min residence and b the mAb at 2\u00a0min residence time at pH 5 in 20\u00a0mM sodium acetate. The protein feed concentration was C\n\nF\n\u00a0=\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mg/mL. Actual column lengths were 4.8\u00a0cm for Nuvia cPrime and 5.3\u00a0cm for Capto MMC. Flow rates were 1 and 0.5\u00a0mL/min for lysozyme and the mAb, respectively. Lines are the pore diffusion model with D\n\ne\n-values in Table\u00a04\nFull size image\nConclusionsThe two multimodal cation exchangers considered in this work have different physical structures and ligands but they exhibit similar trends with regards to the effects of pH and salt concentration on protein binding. Seemingly because of the different presentation of the hydrophobic group in the Capto MMC ligand, this resin appears to be more hydrophobic exhibiting greater salt tolerance across a range of pH values for both lysozyme and the mAb considered in this work compared to Nuvia cPrime. At pH 5, which corresponds approximately to the pK\n\na\n of the ligand carboxyl group, binding capacities for the two resins are similar for lysozyme, but the capacity drops off more rapidly for the mAb in Nuvia cPrime as salt is added. In general, for both resins the adsorption behavior appears to be dominated by hydrophobic interactions at low pH values and by electrostatic interactions at pH 6 or higher.The adsorption rate mechanism controlling protein binding kinetics is also similar in the two materials, apparently dictated largely by pore diffusion. The main difference is, however, the rate of adsorption of the larger mAb. This large difference in rates is attributed to the much larger macropore size of Nuvia cPrime, which allows transport even at very high protein loads with relatively small diffusional hindrance. Another difference between the two materials observed by CLSM, is that at pH 5 the adsorption kinetics in Capto MMC appears to be different in different particles resulting in a distribution of particles that are either completely saturated, partially saturated, or barely saturated with protein even after a long time. We attribute these differences to pore blockage caused by the bound protein in Capto MMC and to subtle variations in structural properties from bead to bead. It is likely that these effects are not seen for Nuvia cPrime since its larger pore size allows diffusion with relatively small hindrance in a manner that is more tolerant of modest variations in structure. In either case, the faster kinetics observed in batch uptake and confocal microscopy experiments results in sharper breakthrough curves and higher dynamic binding capacities for Nuvia cPrime compared to Capto MMC even at short residence times. This provides yet another cautionary note to the extrapolation of dynamic behavior from static uptake studies. For the downstream processing of relatively large protein molecules, such as mAb, pore size may be more critical than the static binding capacity, especially for preparative purpose when high dynamic binding capacity is desired.\n\nReferencesBird, R.B., Stewart, W.E., Lightfoot, E.N.: Transport Phenomena.

A ray-theoretic approach is first used to predict the behavior of light traveling through a particle during transient protein adsorption. When the protein concentration gradient in the particle is sharp, resulting in a steep refractive index gradient, the rays bend and intersect, thereby concentrating light in a sharp ring that marks the position of the adsorption front. This behavior is observed when mass transfer is dominated by pore diffusion and the adsorption isotherm is highly favorable. Applications to protein cation-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and affinity adsorption are then considered using, as examples, the three commercial, agarose-based stationary phases SP-Sepharose-FF, Butyl Sepharose 4FF, and MabSelect. In all three cases, the method provides results that are consistent with measurements based on batch adsorption and previously published data confirming its utility for the determination of protein mass transfer kinetics under a broad range of practically relevant conditions.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProtein chromatographyDiffusionIon exchangeHydrophobic interactionAffinityMicroscopyRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Even with buffered solutions, however, unintended pH transients can occur when the salt concentration varies. For example, the pH temporarily decreases below the feed value when the salt concentration increases and increases above the feed value when the salt concentration is decreased. The intensity and duration of these transients depend on the particular buffer used and the magnitude of the salt concentration step, but in extreme cases the pH can drop by as much as 1.5 pH units creating conditions where the HAP stability is potentially compromised. This work examines the mechanisms leading to pH transients in HAP columns generated by salt steps. The pH excursions are similar to those observed for weak cation exchange columns, but are accompanied by a transient evolution of phosphate which temporarily decreases below the feed value when the salt concentration is increased and increases sharply when the salt concentration is reduced before returning to the feed value. A phenomenological model is developed to describe this behavior by considering the reversible uptake of sodium ions by the P-sites and binding of phosphate ions by the C-sites. The interplay of these two adsorption mechanisms results in complex pH patterns that are consistent with those observed experimentally. In addition to helping understand the underlying mechanisms, the model also provides a useful tool to predict the effects of different buffers and salt concentration and develop corrective measures that can reduce the intensity and duration of the pH transients such as the addition of unretained co-buffers.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsHydoxyapatitepH TransitionsModelingLocal equilibrium theoryRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In most cases, the data are adequately described by assuming that hindered diffusion in liquid-filled pores is the controlling mass transfer mechanism. For these adsorbents, the ratio of particle porosity and tortuosity factor is found to be essentially constant as a function of temperature and composition of the liquid phase. The tortuosity factors are somewhat larger for the smaller pore materials than for the larger-pore ones. However, in the case of a nearly microporous adsorbent, the diffusivity appears to be dependent on temperature to an extent which is not consistent with the assumption of diffusion in rigid, liquid-filled pores.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)Copyright \u00a9 1996 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

In the dilute limit and weak binding conditions, the dimer/monomer selectivity in 10\u00a0mM phosphate at pH 7 varies between 8.7 and 2.3 decreasing with salt concentration in the range of 170\u2013230\u00a0mM NaCl. At high protein loads and strong binding conditions (0\u201360\u00a0mM NaCl), the selectivity in the same buffer is near unity with no NaCl added, but increases gradually with salt concentration reaching high values between 2 and 15 with 60\u00a0mM added NaCl. For these conditions, the two-component adsorption kinetics is controlled by pore diffusion and is predicted approximately by a dual shrinking core model using parameters based on single component equilibrium and kinetics measurements.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsIon exchangeMonoclonal antibodiesMonomer/dimer separationProtein adsorption equilibrium and kineticsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we have examined the separation of an antibody monomer from its dimer on the cation exchange resin Nuvia HR-S (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using frontal analysis. In this process, a mixture of monomer and dimer is continuously fed to the column under conditions where the mixture is favorably bound, resulting in two breakthrough fronts whose monomer and dimer compositions are determined by the multi-component equilibrium and kinetics of the system. Experimentally, the selectivity for dimer was found to vary substantially with ionic strength, being lowest when conditions favor the strongest binding, and increasing to a maximum at intermediate ionic strengths where rapid exchange with the bound monomer can occur. A mechanistic model is developed to describe the competitive binding frontal analysis process, assuming pore diffusion and a significant kinetic resistance to binding as a function of ionic strength. The model was solved numerically and was able to describe both the frontal analysis processes and batch adsorption experimental data, accounting for process parameters such as feed composition and salt concentration. The resulting model can be used to optimize column operating conditions for yield and purity.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsFrontal analysisIon exchangeMonoclonal antibodiesMonomer/dimer separationRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Chromatographic retention, adsorption capacity, and adsorption kinetics are enhanced in the polymer-grafted resin for both BSA and 10\u00a0kDa PEG-BSA as a result of interactions with the grafted polymers. However, the difference between the two resins diminishes for 30\u00a0kDa PEG-BSA indicating that size exclusion effects strongly affect binding in the polymer-grafted material for this larger conjugate. Images of intraparticle concentration profiles obtained by confocal scanning laser microscopy show that the transport mechanisms of both BSA and PEGylated BSA are very different in the two resins. The protein binding kinetics are dominated by ordinary pore diffusion and are essentially independent of the direction of transport for UNOsphere Diol Q as a result of its large pore size. Thus, for this material, displacement of PEGylated BSA by BSA is clearly evident at the intraparticle scale. On the other hand, the protein binding kinetics in Nuvia Q are consistent with a solid diffusion mechanism driven by the adsorbed protein concentration. For this material, protein transport is very fast for one component or two-component co-adsorption of BSA and PEGylated BSA but slows down dramatically for sequential adsorption of these species as a result of heightened diffusional hindrance when the two components counterdiffuse within the resin.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsPEGylated proteinsAnion exchangePolymer graftsDiffusionRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The former contains large open pores while the latter is based on a backbone matrix similar to UNOsphere\u2122 S but also contains grafted charged polymers. Both single component and two-component adsorption are considered. Adsorption capacity and rates are much higher for Nuvia\u2122 S indicating that protein interactions with the charged grafted polymers facilitate both binding and diffusional transport. Intraparticle concentration profiles obtained by confocal microscopy show sharp fronts for UNOsphere\u2122 S but diffuse profiles for Nuvia\u2122 S. Transport is thus controlled by pore diffusion for UNOsphere\u2122 S but is described by a single file diffusion (SFD) mechanism for Nuvia\u2122 S. As a result, single and two-component adsorption occur at similar rates for UNOsphere\u2122 S independent of the direction for transport. For Nuvia\u2122 S, however, transport is very fast for single or two-component co-adsorption but very slow when counter diffusion of the two mAbs takes place within the particles. The transport models developed in this work allow a prediction of separation performance for overloaded conditions typical of process scale applications.Highlights\u25ba Single and multiple mAbs adsorption in macroporous resins is pore diffusion controlled. \u25ba Single and multiple mAbs adsorption in grafted resins is solid diffusion controlled. \u25ba Adsorption rates depend on composition for polymer-grafted resins. \u25ba Single file diffusion model predicts adsorption kinetics in grafted resins.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMonoclonal antibodiesMulticomponent adsorptionPore diffusionSingle file diffusionRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current address: Amgen Manufacturing Limited, Juncos, Puerto Rico.View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While an isocratic separation of the two species could be easily obtained, this mode of operation resulted in excessive dilution of the products. Introduction of a step in eluent concentration, however, permitted a much more efficient separation of the two metals. Separation of Fe3+ and Cr3+remained nearly complete but elution of the more strongly retained species (Cr3+) occurred over a much narrower angle and dilution of the product streams was significantly reduced or even eliminated in some cases. A theoretical model was developed to describe the operation of the continuous annular chromatograph with step elution. With the inclusion of significant dispersive factors (axial dispersion and film mass transfer resistance), the solution of the model equations provided an excellent prediction of the experimental CAC data. Similar improvements to the CAC performance can also be obtained for other separations by manipulating the appropriate variables in a similar manner.

The underlying model assumes that the process is controlled by diffusion in the intraparticle macropores and that the adsorption equilibrium can be described by the Langmuir isotherm. Model results are presented in dimensionless form for isotherms ranging from highly favorable to nearly linear. When the isotherm is highly favorable, operating with 2 to 3 columns in series reduces the amount of adsorbent needed by 15 to 35% when the process is operated with a rapid cycle. Smaller improvements are predicted for longer cycles, while larger improvements are predicted when the isotherm is less favorable. Increasing the number of columns in series beyond 2 or 3 is probably unwarranted since incremental improvements decline rapidly going from 2 to 3 columns. Use of the charts is illustrated with a specific example of application to a protein A capture system.

In these applications, the adsorption isotherm is often nearly linear. As a result, the mass transfer zone is very broad and the breakthrough curve for a single column operation is very shallow, resulting in a poor utilization of the adsorption capacity. In these cases, PCC systems, such that illustrated in Fig. 1, can be used to improve process efficiency (1). These systems simulate a true countercurrent operation by switching multiple fixed-bed columns at periodic time intervals in a merry-go-round arrangement. Just a few columns in series normally provide a close approach to the behavior of an ideal countercurrent process, but without the complexities of actually moving individual particles against a countercurrently moving fluid. The switching can be obtained with a suitable system of valves so that ordinary fixed-bed columns can be used.

The individual columns are switched in position at periodic time intervals as indicated by the arrows. Note that each adsorption column spends equal time in the adsorption train (left) and in the desorption/regeneration train (right).   The advantages of PCC adsorption are well established for conditions where the adsorption isotherm is linear or nearly linear and detailed analyses have been published for these cases based on model simulations (e.g., refs (2-5)) and on experiments (e.g., ref (6)). Besides trace contaminant removal there has also been interest in applying PCC approaches to the adsorptive capture of biomolecules (7-8). Arve and Liapis (8), for example, discussed a PCC system for biospecific adsorption and showed by numerical simulation that subdividing a single fixed bed in two could improve substantially the utilization of adsorption capacity but only for very short beds. More recently, other authors (9) have described equipment to implement PCC adsorption for protein capture in a biopharmaceutical manufacturing environment. An important consideration in assessing the potential advantages of PCC systems for biomolecule capture applications is that the isotherm in bioadsorption is usually highly favorable, which results in relatively narrow mass transfer zones. As a result, the advantages of PCC adsorption over simpler one-column systems will depend strongly on the specific characteristics of the adsorbent and the operating conditions. Thus, in practice, detailed computer simulations or extensive experimentation will be needed to determine potential improvements. In order to simplify this task, this paper provides simple dimensionless design charts that can be used to assess potential advantages of PCC operations without having to resort to detailed computer simulations. The charts are also useful for preliminary design of optimum capture systems and complement previously published work that was either limited to the linear isotherm case (3,5) or based on approximate calculations for a saturation or irreversible isotherm (2).  MATHEMATICAL MODEL The key assumptions made in the mathematical model used in this work are as follows:   Plug flow without axial dispersion;   Intraparticle mass transfer controlled by pore diffusion with negligible boundary layer mass transfer resistance;   Local equilibrium between adsorbed and pore fluid concentrations; and   Adsorption equilibrium described by Langmuir or constant-separation-factor isotherm.   These assumptions are quite reasonable for protein adsorption on stationary phases designed for industrial scale applications. The first assumption is justified by the fact that the reduced velocity, v\u2032\u00a0=\u00a0vd  p /D 0, is usually greater than several hundreds in these applications (10). As a result at the c-term in the van Deemter equation and, hence, adsorption kinetics, is dominant as long as column packing is reasonably uniform and the hardware is well designed. The second assumption is justified for most open-pore adsorbents, such as those used for biospecific or affinity adsorption. In these cases, the Biot number, Bi\u00a0=\u00a0k  f  r  p /D  e , which measures the relative importance of intraparticle and external mass transfer, is usually very large, so that the boundary layer resistance is negligible (11). The third assumption is valid for most practical cases involving ion exchange or hydrophobic binding. However, even for biospecific adsorption, where the binding kinetics can be limiting in certain cases, the time constants for the formation of the ligand-protein bond are usually much smaller than diffusion times in porous particles so that local equilibrium prevails at each point within the particle. Finally, the last assumption is only a mathematical approximation. Obviously, the basic tenets of the Langmuir model (single site binding with no lateral interactions of the adsorbed molecules) are not met in reality by many protein adsorption systems. Nevertheless, the Langmuir model has been shown to be adequate for an accurate, albeit empirical, description of protein adsorption equilibrium in systems as diverse as ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and biospecific adsorption (e.g., see ref (12)). Based on the above assumptions, the following equations and boundary conditions can be used to describe the adsorption train of a PCC system:                   where the average protein concentration in the particle, , given by:    includes both adsorbed molecules as well as those that are present in the intraparticle macropores. Because of assumptions 3 and 4, combining Eqs. 2 and 3 yields the following result:    in place of Eq. 2. In principle, analogous equations can be written to describe the desorption train. In practice, however, in bioprocess applications, the isotherm is extremely sensitive to the mobile phase composition. As a result, while the adsorption isotherm is generally quite favorable for the load step, conditions are usually such that essentially no binding occurs during elution. In this case, elution is completely diffusion limited and fast because of the high concentration driving force. Furthermore, clean-in-place operations are often needed and these are generally dependent only on the time of exposure of the particles to the sanitizing agent. The net result is that the time each adsorbent particle must spend in the desorption/regeneration train is approximately independent of the number of column sections or their length. Thus, we can assume that the switch time is given by:   where t  reg  is the time each particle must spend in the desorption/regeneration train and N  c  is the number of columns in series, which is assumed to be the same for the adsorption and the desorption trains. Accordingly, the total cycle time, required for a column to go through the adsorption or the desorption train is t  cycle \u00a0=\u00a0N  c  t  switch \u00a0=\u00a0t  reg . When this time is sufficient, a clean adsorbent bed is available at each switch so that only the loading columns need to be simulated. If we consider, for example, a system with 4 total columns (2 in the adsorption train and 2 in the desorption train), the total time spent by each particle in each train will be t  reg , while the switch time will be t  reg /2. Obviously, a different number of columns can be used in the adsorption and desorption trains. For instance, if only 1 column is used in the regeneration train, then the switch time must be equal to t  reg  or greater regardless of the number of columns in series in the adsorption train. The dimensionless form of Eqs. 1\u20135 is given by the following equations:                where the dimensionless variables are defined as follows:                               A numerical solution is required and was obtained by discretizing both the particle radial coordinate and the column axial coordinate by finite differences, the latter with a backwards scheme. The resulting ordinary differential equations were then integrated for a given switch period using subroutine DIVPAG of the International Mathematical and Statistical Library (IMSL), which uses Gear's method for stiff systems of ordinary differential equations. In order to simulate the PCC switching of columns, at the end of each period, x and X values were reassigned according to Fig. 1 and the numerical integration repeated until reaching a periodic state. Calculations were done with a number of discretization points sufficiently large that their actual values did not affect the numerical results. For a most difficult case, corresponding to R\u00a0=\u00a00.01, we used 50 axial and 39 radial discretization points. For each case, the cyclic calculation was repeated until the maximum effluent concentration at the outlet from the adsorption train was within 0.1% of the value found in the previous cycle. In dimensionless form, the model parameters are the total number of transfer units, n, the dimensionless total cycle time \u03c4 p \u00a0=\u00a0ut  cycle /\u039bL\u00a0=\u00a0uN  c  t  switch /\u039bL, the isotherm parameter, R, the number of column sections in series, N  c , and the ratios \u03b5/\u039b and \u03b5 p /q  m  b. However, in practice, these two ratios are usually quite small and can be neglected for high-capacity adsorbents with favorable isotherms and dilute solutions, where the partition ratio, \u039b, and the initial isotherm slope, q  m  b, are both large. For these conditions, a general result can be found by setting a maximum outlet concentration at \u03b6=1 and calculating the number of transfer units required using different numbers of columns in series over a range of values of . The product n\u03c4 p  is independent of residence time and can be estimated knowing the adsorbent capacity, the particle size, the effective diffusivity, and the time required for desorption and regeneration of the adsorbent particles by taking t  cycle \u00a0=\u00a0t  reg .  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Numerical results were obtained using typical values of \u03b5\u00a0=\u00a00.35 and \u03b5 p \u00a0=\u00a00.5 for R\u00a0=\u00a00.01, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.9. The two smaller values of R correspond to nearly rectangular, highly-favorable isotherms, while the largest one corresponds to a nearly linear isotherm. Although unlikely to be found in actual biomolecule capture systems, this case is included for comparison purposes. Results for \u039b\u00a0=\u00a010 are given in Figs. 2 and 3 for X  out \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.1 in the periodic state with one, two, or three column sections in series. The corresponding results for X  out \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01 are given in Figs. 4 and 5. In both cases, the relative productivity is calculated as the ratio  at the same value of the dimensionless switch period n\u03c4 p . For these conditions the effects of \u03b5/\u039b and \u03b5 p /q  m  b are negligible, so that the same curves can also be used for larger values of \u039b. For R\u00a0=\u00a00.01 and X  out \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.1, the numerical solution for N  c \u00a0=\u00a01 is practically indistinguishable from the result for the irreversible isotherm limit (R\u00a0=\u00a00) predicted by the analytical solution of Cooper and Liberman (13). The latter is approximated by the following equation valid for n\u00a0>\u00a02.5 (10):    Increasing the number of column sections from N  c \u00a0=\u00a01 to 2 is seen to reduce n, and thus, the total column length, and to increase productivity by a maximum of about 24%. However, the relative effect becomes increasingly less pronounced as n\u03c4 p  is increased. Moreover, increasing N  c  further has only a small incremental effect, suggesting that subdividing the column in more than two sections would likely be unjustified.

R\u00a0=\u00a00.2 for a and b; R\u00a0=\u00a00.9 for c and d.   The results for lower values of R shown in Fig. 3 mimic those in Fig. 2. The main difference is that as R is increased and the adsorption isotherm becomes less favorable, the relative productivity becomes somewhat less dependent on n\u03c4 p  but also more greatly influenced by N  c . Even with R\u00a0=\u00a00.9, however, the maximum improvement in productivity is only about 35% when N  c \u00a0=\u00a02. The results for X  out \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01 shown in Figs. 4 and 5 exhibit similar trends. The improvement with N  c  is very similar in magnitude to the case of X  out \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.1 when R is small, since the breakthrough curve is relatively sharp and there is not much difference in the times at which values of X  out \u00a0=\u00a00.1 and X  out \u00a0=\u00a00.01 are reached. However, the improvement is more pronounced and the maximum shifts to higher n\u03c4 p -values when R is larger and the isotherm closer to linearity.  APPLICATION EXAMPLE The capture of IgG from a 1-mg/cm3 solution on the protein A adsorbent UNOsphere SUPrA (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) is used as an example. The relevant properties determined by Perez-Almodovar (14) are summarized in Table 1. We assume t  cycle \u00a0=\u00a0t  reg \u00a0=\u00a01,800\u00a0s and X  out \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.1. The following values of the dimensionless parameters are obtained:    For these conditions, interpolating between the values read from Fig. 2a and 2b, we obtain n\u00a0=\u00a06.5, 5.3, and 5.1, using N  c \u00a0=\u00a01, 2, and 3, respectively. For a comparison, detailed simulations for the actual parameter values yield n\u00a0=\u00a06.61, 5.30, and 5.11, for N  c \u00a0=\u00a01, 2, and 3, respectively, practically indistinguishable from the values read from the figures. Note that in either case, the corresponding column lengths can be found if a superficial velocity is selected. At 600\u00a0cm/h (u\u00a0=\u00a00.167\u00a0cm/s), we obtain one column with L\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0cm, two columns each 6.1\u00a0cm long, or three columns each 4.0\u00a0cm long. It should be noted that, in practice, there can be technological and procedural limitations to packing reliably and validating large diameter columns with very short bed heights. Clearly, such limitations need to be taken into account in the design of actual systems.

Average ion exchange selectivity coefficients of 5.0\u00a0g/cm3 and 0.75 are obtained for the ion exchange of divalent and monovalent cationic lysine with hydrogen ion, respectively, while values of 1.5 and 1.9 are obtained for the exchange of ammonium and potassium with hydrogen ion. A model based on these binary ion exchange measurements and accounting for the solution equilibria is then developed to predict lysine adsorption over a broad range of conditions. Similarly, resin phase diffusivities are determined by fitting batch binary ion\u2010exchange data with a mass transfer model based on the Nernst\u2010Planck equations. Diffusivities of divalent cationic lysine, monovalent cationic lysine, ammonium ion, and potassium ion are 0.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, 0.20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, and 1.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0cm2/s, respectively. Finally, a general rate model incorporating ion exchange and solution equilibria is developed to predict batch adsorption and desorption of lysine using these diffusivity values over a broad range of conditions. Keywords: Ion exchange equilibriaIon exchange kineticsZwitterionic speciesLysine adsorption\n\n\n\n\n Introduction Ion exchange plays a central role in the industrial production of amino acids and is especially critical in the manufacture of lysine, one of the largest industrial fermentation products.[1] Amino acids are zwitterionic and can be positively charged, neutral, or negatively charged depending on the solution pH. As a result, amino acids that are bound to a cation exchange resin at low pH can be desorbed by raising the pH to a value where the amino acid becomes negatively charged. For practical and economic reasons, ammonia is often used for this purpose. Rational design and optimization of such ion exchange processes requires a knowledge of both the ion exchange equilibrium, which determines the maximum resin loading capacity; and the ion exchange kinetics; which determine the dynamic binding capacity as a function of flow rate as well as the time and amount of desorbent required for elution. As a result, a quantitative understanding of these two factors is critical. The ion exchange equilibrium of several neutral and acidic amino acids on cation exchangers has been investigated by a number of authors.2\u20137 As shown by these authors, amino acid adsorption on cation exchangers occurs via the stoichiometric exchange of amino acid cations. Accordingly, there is no significant binding of the zwitterionic species indicating that the proximity of positive and negative charges in the zwitterion prevents a favorable electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged functional groups in the resin. Equilibrium models also have been developed, including models based on the homogeneous and heterogeneous mass action law for ion exchange2\u20136 [8] and activity coefficients\u2013based models where partitioning of all cationic, anionic, and zwitterionic species between the resin and the solution phase is described explicitly.[7]  The kinetics of ion exchange of certain neutral amino acids in cation exchange resins has also been studied. The intraparticle diffusivities of the amino acids alanine, \u03b1\u2010aminobutyric acid, leucine, and phenylalanine were determined by Jones and Carta[9] for sulfonated poly(styrene\u2010divinylbenzene) (DVB) cation exchange resins with degrees of cross\u2010linking between 2% and 10%. For resins with 8% cross\u2010linking, these authors found diffusivities between 0.01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 and 0.001\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0cm2/s, corresponding to ratios of resin and solution diffusivity, D/D 0, in the range 0.07 to 0.005. These results suggest that diffusion of the bulkier amino acids in these resins is hindered to a much greater extent than that of small inorganic ions, for which D/D 0 is around 0.1.[10] [11] A similar result was obtained by Melis et al.[6] for the diffusivity of proline in an 8% DVB resin (D/D 0\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Jones and Carta[9] also provided an empirical correlation to predict amino acid diffusivities in cation exchange resins as a function of their molar volume. Although no data seems to be available in the literature on the resin\u2010phase diffusivity of divalent amino acid cations, the diffusivities of divalent inorganic ions are known to be much smaller than are the corresponding values for monovalent cations, or about 1/100 of the solution diffusivity value.[10] [11] As a result, the resin\u2010phase diffusivity of amino acids with a positively charged side chain can also be expected to be substantially smaller than that for the cations of amino acids with uncharged side chain.  Ion Exchange Lysine Limited data are available in the literature on the ion exchange of lysine or other divalent amino acids. Kawakita et al.[12] studied the equilibrium uptake of lysine on cation exchange resins with degree of cross\u2010linking between 4% and 16% in ammonium form. Uptake isotherms were obtained at high pH (\u223c6), where only monovalent lysine and ammonium ion are present, and at low pH (pH\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.8\u20131), where only divalent lysine is present. The ion exchange equilibrium of lysine with an 8% cross\u2010linked resin in hydrogen form has also been studied by Dye et al.[2] These authors considered the exchange of mono valent/divalent lysine mixtures at intermediate pH values but only for the hydrogen form of the resin. No values of the resin phase diffusivity of lysine cations seem to have been reported in the literature, although the ratio D/D 0 can be estimated from the correlation of Jones and Carta.[9] The solution diffusivity of lysine, D 0, can be estimated from the Wilke\u2010Chang equation[13] to be 0.69\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0cm2/s using a molar volume of 171\u00a0cm3/mol based on the LeBas volumes. For an 8% cross\u2010linked resin in hydrogen form, the Jones and Carta correlation yields D/D 0\u00a0=\u00a00.031 or D  Lys + \u00a0=\u00a02.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0cm2/s. The resin phase diffusivity of divalent lysine cannot be estimated from this correlation. However, based on the known behavior of inorganic cations, we can expect D  Lys ++  to be substantially smaller. The objective of this paper is threefold. The first objective is to provide a consistent set of ion\u2010exchange equilibrium data for a system comprising lysine, ammonia, potassium, and hydrogen ion over a broad range of pH. Data for several binary ion exchange equilibria are obtained and equilibrium constants are derived taking into account the ionic distribution of lysine and ammonia species in solution. The second objective is to characterize the kinetics of ion exchange by performing batch experiments for conditions where monovalent lysine, divalent lysine, and their mixtures are present. Finally, the third objective is to develop a model to describe ion exchange equilibria and kinetics in these multicomponent systems. The application of these models to predict the behavior of single column systems is discussed in Part II of this work while the application to multicolumn merry\u2010go\u2010round systems for lysine recovery is discussed in Part III.   Materials and Methods The resin used in this work is Dowex HCR\u2010W2 (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI), a typical gel\u2010type poly(styrene\u2010divinylbenzene) cation exchanger with a nominal DVB content of 8% and sulfonic acid functional groups. The mean particle diameter of the hydrogen form resin is 714\u00a0\u00b5m as determined from microphotographs. The dry weight of the resin in H\u2010form is 0.48\u00a0g\u00a0dry/g of hydrated resin, while the density of the resin beads in hydrogen form is 0.65\u00a0g\u00a0dry/cm3 of hydrated particle. The total ion exchange capacity of the resin was determined to be 5.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mequiv/g dry H\u2010form resin. These values are consistent with previous determinations in our laboratory.[4]  L\u2010lysine was obtained from Ajinomoto Co., Inc. (Raleigh, NC). Potassium chloride was purchased from Sigma Chemical. Co. (St. Louis, MO), while ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride were purchased from Fisher Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA). Actual lysine fermentation broths contain many cationic impurities. However, potassium can be used as a representative interfering species.[14] Thus potassium chloride and potassium hydroxide were also obtained from Fisher and used in this work. Ion exchange equilibria were determined by a batch method. Solutions containing lysine, ammonia, and potassium ion were prepared with constant concentrations of chloride ion using stock solutions of free\u2010base lysine, lysine hydrochloride, ammonium hydroxide, potassium chloride and hydrochloride (HCL). Aliquots of these solutions (10\u00a0mL) were than added to test tubes containing various amounts of wet H\u2010form resin, which were centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min in a perforated centrifuge tube to remove interstitial water. The tubes were rotated for 4 hours, which was sufficient to reach equilibrium as indicated by batch experiments where the solution concentrations were monitored as a function of time. The amounts adsorbed by the resin were calculated from the residual composition of the solution phase using a material balance. The HPLC analyses were used to determine the concentrations of ammonia, lysine, and potassium ion with an Alltech Associates, Inc. (Deerfield, IL) Universal Cation ion\u2010exchange column (4.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0mm). The mobile phase was a 6\u00a0mM aqueous solution of methane sulfonic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St., Louis, MO) and detection was with a waters Model 430 conductivity detector (Waters, Milford, MA) without ion suppression. The sample size was 5\u00a0\u00b5L. Ion exchange rates were measured in a 100\u00a0mL agitated and thermostated glass vessel at 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0C. The vessel is equipped with a magnetically driven Teflon impeller, which rests on the vessel's conical bottom preventing damage to the particles while ensuring their complete suspension and mixing of the solution. The agitation rate was approximately 300\u00a0rpm. To conduct the experiments, samples of solutions containing a selected counterion were added to the vessel and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. Preweighed resin samples were then quickly added and the course of the exchange process monitored by taking 0.5\u00a0mL samples and analyzing them by HPLC, as described previously. Ammonium and sodium ion exchange kinetics experiments were also followed by continuously monitoring the electrical conductivity of the solution using a conductivity meter (Orion Research, Model 135A) with a probe dipped in the agitated vessel.  Experimental Results and Modeling  Ion Exchange Equilibria In solution, lysine and ammonia dissociate according to the following reactions and equilibrium ratios:    The distribution of the different species is a function of pH and is shown in Fig. 1, based on K\u2010values from Ref.[15]. It can be seen that at pH values below 1 lysine exists predominately in divalent cationic form, while at pH values above 4, monovalent lysine form is the dominant cationic form. Between pH values of 1 and 4, monovalent and divalent cationic forms coexist. Ammonia, on the other hand, is a stronger base and completely dissociates to NH3 above pH 10.5.

The lysine adsorption isotherm by the hydrogen form resin over different ranges of solution pH is shown in Fig. 2a. These experiments were done at three different but constant levels of the chloride co\u2010ion, namely 0\u00a0M, 0.15\u00a0M, and 0.35\u00a0M. As a result, the pH varied with lysine concentration for each set as shown in Fig. 2b. This was not the case, however, for 0\u00a0M chloride. For these conditions, the pH was always close to the isoelectric point of lysine (\u223c9.74) as no other buffering species were present. As is seen in Fig. 2a, at the high chloride concentration, the lysine adsorption isotherm is favorable and approaches a maximum capacity close to one half of the total resin capacity. For these conditions, the pH remains low and lysine uptake occurs via the stoichiometric exchange of divalent lysine cations and hydrogen ion. Near the isoelectric point (0\u00a0M chloride), however, the isotherm becomes practically irreversible with an uptake capacity close to the total resin capacity. Here the uptake process is controlled by the exchange of monovalent lysine cations and hydrogen ion. For these conditions, since the hydrogen ion concentration is very low, the lysine uptake isotherm is nearly rectangular. Finally, at the intermediate chloride concentration, the uptake isotherm is S\u2010shaped going from the favorable divalent lysine\u2010hydrogen ion exchange behavior at low lysine concentration to the monovalent lysine\u2010hydrogen ion exchange behavior at high lysine concentrations. For intermediate lysine concentrations both exchange reactions take place. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. I.

In order to model this complicated behavior, it is necessary to analyze the results for the individual binary ion exchange equilibria. These are shown in Fig. 3a\u2013d plotted in the usual form in terms of ionic fractions for the binary systems Lys++/H+, Lys+/NH4 +, NH4 +/H+ and K+/H+. It should be noted that it is not possible to obtain reliable data for the Lys+/H+ exchange equilibrium in a direct way since at the pHs required to have lysine exclusively in monovalent cationic form, the hydrogen ion concentration is so low that the lysine uptake isotherm is practically irreversible. However, the equilibrium for this binary can be extracted by comparing the data for the Lys+/NH4 + and NH4 +/H+ binaries. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. I.

As seen in Fig. 3a, the Lys++/H+ exchange is highly favorable consistent with the behavior of divalent inorganic cations.[10] The exchange of ammonium ion and potassium ion for hydrogen ion is also favorable although the selectivity is not as high as for divalent lysine, since the electro selectivity effect is not present in these monovalent exchanges. On the other hand, the Lys+/NH4 + is distinctly unfavorable. The relevant binary ion exchange reactions are given by the following equations:    The corresponding mass action law selectivity coefficient expressions are     In these equations C  i  and q  i  are the solution and the resin\u2010phase concentrations, respectively. The selectivity coefficient for the monovalent lysine\u2010hydrogen ion exchange can be obtained by combining Eqs. 2 and 3, yielding    Average selectivity values obtained by fitting Eqs. 1\u20134 to the data are summarized in Table 1 and curves calculated accordingly are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that these constant\u2010selectivity curves provide a good fit of the data in most cases. An exception is the exchange of monovalent lysine for which the selectivity decreases significantly as the ionic fraction of lysine in the resin phase increases. This effect has also been seen for the exchange of other monovalent amino acids.3\u20135 [7] While thermodynamic nonidealities are probably contributing factors, steric or size exclusion effects and adsorbate\u2010adsorbate interactions are likely more significant causes of this behavior. In fact, it should be noted that full saturation of the resin with monovalent lysine requires the resin to contain 5.3\u00a0mmol/g dry resin or about 0.77\u00a0g/g dry resin. Since the resin in H\u2010form contains approximately only 0.5\u00a0g of water per g of dry resin, it is not surprising that deviations from ideality due to steric hindrance and adsorbate\u2010adsorbate interactions occur at these high lysine loadings. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. I. Ion Exchange Equilibrium and KineticsAll authorsHidetada Nagai & Giorgio Cartahttps://doi.org/10.1081/SS-200041091Published online:08 July 2010  Table 1. \u00a0Selectivity coefficients for ion exchange with H+  \nDownload CSVDisplay Table As suggested by Carta et al.[8] a heterogeneous ion\u2010exchange model can be used for an empirical description of these effects. Following the formulation of Melis et al.[16] with the assumption that ion exchange occurs on distinct functional groups having different selectivity, ion exchange equilibria are described by the following equations:    where S  j   i/H +  is the selectivity coefficient for exchange of ion i and H + on group j, Y  i   j \u00a0=\u00a0z  i  q  i   j /q 0  j  is the ionic fraction of ion i on group j, q 0  j  is concentration of groups j and n is the number of functional group types. This model was fitted to the monovalent lysine data assuming n\u00a0=\u00a02 and q 0 1\u00a0=\u00a0q 0 2\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0q 0. In this case, the average selectivity coefficient S\u00af i/H +  is given by:[16]    The fitted values of S 1  Lys +/H +  and S 2  Lys +/H +  are given in Table 1 and the calculated line is shown in Fig. 3b. Clearly, the heterogeneous exchange model provides an improved fit, although a significant algebraic complication is introduced. However, it should be noted that despite the success of the model in fitting the data, the physical meaning is not exactly defined since all potential sources of nonidealities leading to nonconstant selectivity are lumped into the heterogeneous model parameters. In order to complete the general description of ion exchange equilibria it is necessary to combine the solution equilibrium expressions for lysine and ammonia with those for ion exchange equilibrium. In the general case, the charged lysine species and ammonium ion concentrations are given by:    where C  Lys  and C  N  are the total lysine and total ammonia concentrations. In turn, these concentrations are bound by the electroneutrality condition, which is given by    This equation combined with Eqs. 9\u201312 can be solved for C  H +  if the total lysine, total ammonia, and potassium ion concentrations are known. Once the concentrations of individual charged species are calculated, they can be inserted in Eqs. 1\u20134 or 6\u20137 in order to calculate the resin\u2010phase composition. The solid lines in Fig. 2 show the results of these computations. It can be seen that there is an excellent agreement between experimental and predicted lysine uptake as well as between experimental and predicted solution pH. Although not shown here, predictions for several other conditions were also successful.[17]    Ion Exchange Kinetics Batch ion exchange curves showing the solution concentration as a function of time are given in Fig. 4 for the following conditions: uptake of divalent lysine on ammonia form resin (Fig. 4a); adsorption of monovalent lysine on ammonia form resin (Fig. 4b); adsorption of ammonia on hydrogen form resin (Fig. 4c); and adsorption of potassium on hydrogen form resin (Fig. 4d). Experiments were conducted with a minimum of two different ratios of the resin mass to solution volume and yielded consistent results.[17] The most noticeable effect is the large difference in the rate of ion exchange, which is slowest for the divalent lysine\u2010ammonia exchange (Fig. 4a) and fastest for the potassium ion\u2010hydrogen ion exchange (Fig. 4d). It should be noted that the divalent lysine experiment actually involves the exchange of the three species Lys++, NH4 +, and H+ since the pH is ultimately quite low.

For these fairly concentrated solutions and with the relatively large size of the Dowex HCR\u2010W2 particles, the kinetics of ion exchange can be assumed to be controlled by intraparticle diffusion.[10] [11] The following equations and boundary conditions can thus be used to describe the ion exchange kinetics.  For the resin beads:     where       For the solution:      In these equations, r  p  is the particle radius, q* i  and q  i  0 are the interfacial and initial resin compositions, respectively, M is the mass of resin, V is the solution volume, and the C  i  0 is the initial solution concentrations. According to the Nernst\u2010Planck model, the counterion fluxes and electrostatiscally coupled and can be expressed as[11]    where N is the number of counterions and:    D  N  is the diffusivity of a reference counterion, e.g., H+. These equations neglect the presence of zwitterionic and negatively charged lysine in the resin, as these species are expected to be largely excluded due to steric and Donnan potential effects. Unprotonated ammonia, however, is considered. Its effect was not important in the batch experiments, but was found to be significant in column experiments as discussed in part II of this paper. Thus, it is included for completeness. In the following discussion we consider the special case of simultaneously diffusing lysine, ammonia, and hydrogen ion, which is relevant to the experiments in Fig. 4. For this system it should be recognized that dissociation of divalent lysine could also occur in the resin phase. Combining the expressions for the selectivity coefficient for divalent and monovalent lysine (Eqs. 1 and 2) with the expression for the dissociation constant of divalent lysine in solution we obtain:    Using the known p K 1\u2010value and the average selectivity coefficient values and converting S  Lys ++/H +  to a volume/volume basis using the resin density, we obtain pK\u20321\u00a0=\u00a03.00. This represents the dissociation constant for divalent lysine in the resin phase. It is somewhat different from the value in solution, but this can be expected because of the high ion concentration in the resin phase and the effects of the elastic polyelectrolyte matrix, In any case, this relationship introduces a further coupling of diffusion fluxes, which can be handled as discussed by Hwang and Helfferich[18] for the general case of ion exchange accompanied by fast reversible reactions. By combining Eq. 30 with Eqs. 22 and 20, we obtain:     In turn, these relationships can be used to express the partial derivatives of q  Lys  and q  Lys ++  appearing in Eqs. 14 and 27 in terms of q  Lys + . For brevity, the final equations are omitted but can be found in Ref.[17]. The resulting equations were solved numerically to obtain the concentrations of ammonium ion and monovalent lysine in the resin. We used a finite difference method described in Ref.[19] to discretize the partial differential equations and subroutine DIVPAG of the IMSL Mathematical and Statistical Libraries (Visual Numerics, Inc., San Ramon, CA) to solve the resulting system of ordinary differential equations. This subroutine used Gear's method for stiff systems of equations. The interfacial composition was calculated at each integration step by calculating the solution pH and equilibrium composition as previously described. Individual diffusivities in the resin were determined by fitting the numerical solution of these equations to the experimental data and are given in Table 2. In order to reduce the fitting problem to a single parameter, the hydrogen ion diffusivity, D H+ , was assumed to be 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0cm2/s according to literature data for 8% DVB cation exchange resins (see Ref.[9]). As seen in Table 2, the diffusivity of divalent lysine is much smaller than that of monovalent lysine, which is consistent with the behavior of divalent inorganic ions. In turn, the diffusivity of monovalent lysine is much smaller than that of ammonium and potassium ion. This occurs because of the large size of the lysine molecule, which causes its diffusion in the resin to be severely hindered. The ratio D  i /D  i  0 is also shown in Table 2 along with the solution diffusivities, This ratio is about 1/200 for divalent lysine and about 1/30 for the monovalent form. The latter is consistent with the behavior of other monovalent amino acids.[9] For the smaller inorganic cations, ammonium and potassium, the ratio D  i /D  i  0 is about 1:10 as there is much less diffusional hindrance for these species than there is for the bulkier lysine molecule.

In the first, divalent and monovalent lysine forms are present simultaneously, while in the second divalent lysine and hydrogen ion and desorbed with ammonia at high pH. In both cases, the ion exchange process involves multicomponent diffusion. The agreement between these experimental results (as well other discussed in Ref.[17]) and the model predictions is not perfect, but it is still adequate for practical purposes, indicating that the model captures the essential characteristics of coupled transport in this complex system.

Conclusions Equilibrium and kinetic parameters for the ion exchange of lysine on a strong acid cation exchanger were obtained along with models to describe the dynamics of batch adsorption and desorption. Ion exchange equilibria are described by taking into account the dissociation of protonated lysine species in solution and in the resin phase and expressed in terms of ionic fractions of the counterions. The selectivity coefficients for different binary exchange systems were found to be fairly constant, so that equilibria could be modeled using the mass action law. An exception was the case of monovalent lysine at high resin loading, where the selectivity coefficient appears to decrease substantially as the lysine loading approaches the total ion exchange capacity. This effect can be attributed to steric and size exclusion factors and can be described empirically with a heterogeneous ion exchange equilibrium model. The intraparticle diffusivities determined from batch experiments for ammonium ion and potassium ion found in this work are consistent with literature values.[11] Moreover, the diffusivity of monovalent lysine appears consistent with predictions based on the correlation of Jones and Carta.[9] A much lower diffusivity is found for divalent lysine. Since diffusion in gel\u2010type resins like the one considered in this work occurs through gel pores in close proximity to the charged functional groups bound to the polymeric backbone, it is not surprising that diffusion divalent lysine is much slower than the monovalent form since the former is likely to interact more strongly with the resin's functional groups. The general kinetic model developed in this work was also found consistent with more complicated cases involving multicomponent transport with the simultaneous presence of divalent and monovalent lysine forms and for desorption. Thus, it can of used to predict batch adsorption under a broad range of conditions. Applications of the results of these studies to fixed\u2010bed behavior are discussed in Part II of this work.

The pH temporarily decreases before gradually returning to the feed value when the salt concentration increases, potentially compromising the stability of the HAP when either the magnitude or duration of the pH drop is excessive. The opposite happens when the salt concentration decreases. In this work we address the effects of several key variables: the flow rate, the particle size, the use of salt gradients instead of steps, the use of different co-buffers, the surface area of the HAP, and the use of a slightly alkaline wash prior to increasing the salt concentration. Flow rate and particle size were found to have virtually no effect, demonstrating that the pH transitions are equilibrium rather than kinetically driven. Salt gradients resulted in smaller pH drops compared to steps since the exchanged protons are diluted over the gradient volume. MES and histidine used as co-buffers were effective at reducing the duration of the pH transitions but did not affect their magnitude. The same result was found when comparing HAP samples with different surface areas, with the lower surface area HAP yielding much shorter duration but similar pH drops and rises. Finally, washing the HAP column with a pH 7.5 buffer prior to the salt step was found to dramatically reduce the subsequent pH drop. In general, there was good agreement between these results and predictions based on our previously developed model.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsHydroxyapatitepH transitionsModelingManagingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental data are obtained in a 1\u00a0cm diameter laboratory column and in preparative scale columns with diameters of 20, 30, and 45\u00a0cm. The results are consistent with a model that assumes a linear relationship between bed compression and relative flow velocity. Surprisingly, the packing compressibility is essentially independent of column diameter for the preparative columns. As a result, after accounting for the variation in extraparticle porosity caused by compression, the column pressure drop is accurately predictable using the Carman\u2013Kozeny equation. A model is also developed to predict productivity for IgG capture as a function of operating conditions based on dynamic binding capacity data presented in Part I of this work. For typical conditions, the model predicts maximum productivity at low residence times, between 1 and 1.5\u00a0min, when the dynamic binding capacity is at about 70\u201380% of the maximum. Combining the two models for column pressure and for dynamic binding capacity allows the design of preparative scale columns that maximize productivity while meeting specified pressure constraints.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsIgGProtein APressure\u2013flow curvesColumn packingOptimizationModelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The model is restricted to linear isotherms and treats mass transfer effects with the linear driving force approximation. The solution is obtained for periodic, rectangular feed pulses, with an arbitrary gradient shape and type, and is given in the form of a convergent series that allows a direct calculation of the effluent profile and of the average product concentration. Calculations for small feed pulses, show that the solution gives the retention time and peak spreading predicted by the linear solvent strength theory for reversed phase chromatography, in the limit of Gaussian peaks. For larger feed pulses the solution predicts asymmetric peaks with concentrations exceeding that of the feed sample. The theory developed is succesfully used to predict volume overload effects in gradient elution from isocratic elution data for an experimental system.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1992 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Two peaks are observed without a hold step while a third more strongly retained peak becomes noticeable with a hold time as low as 10\u00a0min. As the hold time is increased further, the first peak gradually disappears, the second peak initially increases and then decreases, and the third peak continuously increases. Dynamic light scattering shows that the third peak contains significant levels of aggregates formed in the column. Circular dichroism, HX-MS analyses of the eluted fraction, in-line fluorescence detection, and bound-state HX-MS analysis indicate that the aggregates derive from an unfolded intermediate that is slowly formed while the protein is bound to the resin. Aggregate formation does not occur on a different CEX resin, Nuvia HR-S, with similar particle size but with a more homogenous structure or when the sodium acetate load buffer is replaced with arginine acetate. The two early eluting peaks observed for POROS XS regardless of hold time are shown to comprise exclusively monomeric species. A set of biophysical measurements as well as mechanistic modeling support the hypothesis that these two peaks form as a result of the presence of weak and strong binding sites on the resin having, respectively, fast and slow binding kinetics.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsMonoclonal antibodiesCation exchangeUnfoldingAggregationHX-MSChromatography modelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Inverse size exclusion chromatography indicated a bimodal distribution of pore sizes consisting mostly of small pores, 4\u20135\u00a0nm in radius and likely associated with the grafted tentacles. Similar results were obtained for resin samples fouled by process use, indicating that the core structure of these particles is unchanged. Transmission electron micrographs showed that the resin backbone matrix has a microgranular structure. However, a dense skin layer, 0.2\u20130.5\u00a0\u03bcm thick, was also seen at the exterior surface of the fouled particles. The binding capacity attained for BSA after 90\u00a0min of contact was 165\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0mg/mL for both virgin and fouled samples, close to the equilibrium capacity of 178\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mg/mL attained after 24\u00a0h. On the other hand, the capacities attained at 90\u00a0min for the much larger thyroglobulin were only 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 and 25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mg/mL, respectively, for virgin and fouled samples. The BSA adsorption kinetics was also slower for the fouled resin, but much larger kinetic differences between virgin and fouled resin were seen for thyroglobulin. Based on the shape of intraparticle protein concentration profiles determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), the protein transport mechanism is consistent with solid diffusion for both virgin and fouled resin samples and proteins. However, transport is hindered by the foulant layer to a much greater extent for thyroglobulin as a result of its larger size. Additional measurements indicated that the foulant layer is consistent with mAb aggregates irreversibly bound at the particle exterior surface.Highlights\u25ba A tentacle-type anion exchanger is fouled in a mAb purification process. \u25ba Fouling occurs by deposition of a thin proteinaceous layer on the bead surface. \u25ba The effects of fouling on performance depend on molecular size of the adsorbate.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsAnion exchange resinsMonoclonal antibodiesPolishingFoulingMass transfer mechanismsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inverse size-exclusion chromatography (iSEC) show similar structures for the two resins, both containing 200\u20131000\u00a0nm pores that transect a network of much smaller pores. For non-binding conditions, trends of the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) as a function of reduced velocity are consistent with perfusion. The estimated intraparticle flow fractions for these conditions are 0.0018 and 0.00063 for POROS HS 20 and HS 50, respectively. For strong binding conditions, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) shows asymmetrical intraparticle concentrations profiles and enhanced rates of IgG adsorption on POROS HS 20 at 1000\u00a0cm/h. The corresponding effective diffusivity under flow is 2\u20133 times larger than for non-flow conditions and much larger than observed for POROS HS 50, consistent with available models. For VLPs, however, adsorption is confined to a thin layer near the particle surface for both resins, suggesting that the bound VLPs block the pores.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsPerfusion chromatographyMass transferProteinsVirus-like-particlesRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic light scattering shows that there is no significant effect of the counterion type on the mAb aqueous diffusivity. The counterion type also does not affect substantially the structure of the polymer grafts, nor does it affect the stoichiometry of the protein ion exchange process. While no counterion effects are also observed on the protein mass transfer kinetics for the macroporous matrix, very large effects are seen for the polymer grafted matrices with protein adsorption rates increasing dramatically in the order Ca++\u00a0>\u00a0Arg+\u00a0>\u00a0Na+\u00a0>\u00a0TBAH+. This order is the same order in which the relative protein binding strength decreases. Accordingly, the counterions leading to weaker protein binding also lead to faster protein diffusion. Although the quantitative aspects are different, the same trends hold for different proteins (lysozyme and lactoferrin) and for an agarose-based matrix also containing grafted polymers (Capto\u2122 S). The underlying mechanism is qualitatively consistent with protein transport occurring through a hopping process driven by the adsorbed protein concentration within the apparently flexible network structure formed by the grafted polymers. From a practical viewpoint, the results show that improved protein adsorption kinetics in polymer-grafted cation exchanger and, hence, improved performance, can be obtained by selecting particular counterions.Highlights\u25ba The nature of the counterion affects protein adsorption kinetics in polymer-grafted cation exchangers but not in macroporous matrices. \u25ba Arginine and calcium ion provide the greatest enhancement of the protein adsorption kinetics in polymer-grafted matrices. \u25ba Protein adsorption kinetics and protein binding strength are inversely correlated in polymer-grafted media.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProteinsIon exchangeCounterionsEquilibriumKineticsGrafted mediaRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current address: Amgen Manufacturing Limited, PO Box 4060, Juncos, PR 00777-4060, USA.View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The equilibrium uptake is found to be relatively insensitive to temperature, particularly at high amino acid loadings on the resin. However, mass transfer rates for conditions where the intraparticle resistance is dominant are found to increase substantially as temperature is increased, with the effect being more pronounced for resins of higher degree of crosslinking. Intraparticle diffusivities are obtained from alkaline desorption experiments, while external film mass transfer coefficients in an agitated contactor are obtained from the rates of amino acid uptake from a dilute solution. Intraparticle diffusivities are strongly dependent on the hydration water of the resin and they increase substantially as temperature is increased.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsAmino acidsPhenylalanineIon-exchange resinsEquilibriumMass transferTemperature effectsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1997 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Mass transfer is represented by pseudosteady-state diffusion through a stagnant film of thickness equal to one-fifth of the particle radius. An exact analytic solution is found for the case of homovalent exchange and an approximate solution for the case of heterovalent exchange. Results obtained from the exact solution of the Nernst-Planck model are compared to those obtained using the film-model approximation for the case of ternary exchange in infinite-batch and fixed-bed systems. The predictions based on the film-model approximation are in good agreement with the exact solution for both homovalent and heterovalent ion exchange, indicating that the film-model approximation can be used effectively in numerical simulations of complex ion-exchange systems.

Generally, for ion exchange on a fully ionized resin, intraparticle diffusion rates are described by the Nernst-Planck equations. Accordingly, the flux of an ion is the result of two additive contributions: one proportional to the ion concentration gradient and the other proportional to the electrical potential gradient that develops when the diffusivities of the exchanging counterions are different. The prediction of ion-exchange rates using these equations has been addressed by several authors for both binary 2-3 and ternary systems [4]. The corresponding flux equations, however, are complicated and, in general, have to be solved numerically together with the particle conservation equations in spherical coordinates. This sometimes results in an unmanageable numerical complexity which hinders the implementation of effective codes for the simulation of complex systems [5]. Simplified approaches for the prediction of ion-exchange kinetics have been developed by several authors. For example, for the case of binary exchange, Rendueles de la Vega et al. [6] suggested the use of a constant \u201ccorrected Fick diffusivity\u201d whose value is determined empirically by matching a numerical solution of the constant-diffusivity model to the numerical solution of the exact model. For the case of multicomponent exchange, Melis et al. [5] developed an approximation based on the assumption that the intraparticle concentration profiles are parabolic. This approximation was shown to be adequate for moderate values of the diffusivity ratios of the exchanging counterions. However, this approach fails when the diffusivities are very different since in this case the concentration profiles are far from parabolic [7]. More recently, Carta et al. [7] developed a film model approximation for binary exchange which was shown to correctly predict the effects of the electric field on the exchange kinetics for both high and low values of the diffusivity ratio. Numerical results obtained for binary exchange in batch and column systems were shown to be in good agreement with those obtained from the numerical solution of the exact model. In this paper we provide an extension of the film-model approximation to multicomponent systems. An exact analytic solution of the film-model equations is obtained for the case of homovalent exchange, yielding an explicit expression for the ion flux as a function of the average resin loadings and the surface concentrations. An approximate solution is also obtained for heterovalent exchange. In both cases, test numerical results obtained for ternary exchange in batch and column systems are found to be in good agreement with predictions based on the exact model, indicating that the film-model approximation can be used effectively in numerical simulations of complex ion-exchange systems.  THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT  Multicomponent Model Development We consider a completely ionized ion-exchange resin with M exchangeable counterions. The flux of ion i is described by   where \u03c6 is the electrical potential gradient. In dimensionless form, this equation can be written as   where J *  i  = z  i  J  i  r P/ is a dimensionless flux, y  i  is the equivalent fraction of ion i, \u03c1 = r/r P is a dimensionless radial coordinate, and \u03d5 = \u2111\u03c6/\u2111 T is the dimensionless electrical potential. The parameter \u03b1i = [Dbar]A/[Dbar]i is the ratio of ion diffusivities for a reference counterion A and ion i. Electroneutrality and the condition of no net current transport yield the following equations:      Combining Eqs. 2-4 gives the following expressions for the flux:         These flux equations are used in conjunction with the relevant conservation equations and boundary conditions which may be written as follows. For the particles:               where  is a dimensionless time and y  i  * and y  i  0 are the interfacial and initial ionic fractions of ion i, respectively. For a column:            where \u03c4\u2032 =  and \u039b = (1 \u2212 \u03b5)q 0/\u03b5C 0. External mass transfer resistances and axial dispersion are neglected in these equations. For an ideal system, y *  i  is related to the fluid-phase equivalent fraction by the mass action law:   Dimensional forms of these equations can be found in Ref. [1]. A numerical solution is generally required, and in this work it was obtained by finite differences as discussed by Carta et al. [7].   Film-Model Approximation The film-model approximation is based on the recognition of the fact that for adsorption and ion-exchange calculations, the intraparticle mass transfer resistance can be represented by the resistance offered by a flat solid film of thickness equal to  of the particle radius through which pseudosteady-state diffusion occurs 7-8. For constant diffusivity cases, this representation provides a result mathematically equivalent to the well-known linear driving force approximation (LDF) [9]. Accordingly, the rate of mass transfer is proportional to the difference between the solute concentration at the adsorbent particle surface and the average concentration in the particle. However, as shown by Carta and Cincotti and Carta et al., even when the diffusivity varies with composition, integration of the pseudosteady-state conservation equations across the film provides useful quantitatively predictive rate equations. In this case a correction factor dependent on both surface and average concentrations, is multiplied times the linear driving force term to obtain the appropriate rate equation. The film-model approximation for an ion-exchange system with M counterions can be derived from Eq. 2 following a treatment similar to that of Wildhagen et al. [10]. Assuming pseudosteady-state diffusion across the film, we have   Combining Eqs. 2 and 9 gives the differential equation   with boundary conditions      Summing Eq. 10 over all counterions gives the result     Exact Solution for Homovalent Exchange For the case of homovalent exchange, Eq. 11 reduces to   or   Combining Eqs. 2, 9, and 13 yields   where \u03b3 i  is an integration constant. This equation can be integrated across the film with boundary conditions 10a and 10b giving   The constant m is then obtained by imposing that the sum of the fluxes for all counterions is zero. After some algebraic manipulations we obtain      Finally, the film-model rate equation is obtained by combining Eq. 17 with an overall balance for the particle , yielding   When the diffusivities are all equal, Eq. 18 reduces to the classical LDF approximation . However, when the diffusivities are different, Eq. 18 describes the effect of varying resin-phase composition on the coupled transport process. For batch ion-exchange with a constant surface composition, Eq. 18 can be integrated directly. For other situations, Eq. 18 is coupled to the appropriate conservation equations, for example, Eq. 7 for a fixed bed, replacing the partial differential equations for the particles (Eq. 6) with ordinary differential equations.   Approximate Solution for Heterovalent Exchange An exact solution of the film-model equations for heterovalent exchange is apparently not possible. However, an approximate solution can be obtained by taking the electrical potential gradient to be equal to the average electrical potential difference across the film divided by the film thickness. Integrating Eq. 11 across the film gives the following result:   Taking d\u03d5/d\u03c1\u223c 5\u0394\u03d5 give the following result for the flux of ion i:   The constant m \u2032 is obtained by imposing that Eq. 4 is satisfied, which yields   A trial-and-error procedure is needed to find the value of m \u2032 that satisfies this equation.    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In order to ascertain the usefulness of the film-model approximation for multicomponent ion exchange, numerical calculations were performed for a ternary system (A, B, C) for batch exchange in a infinite batch and for a fixed bed with constant initial and feed concentrations. Figure 1(a) shows the average resin loading for batch exchange for the case of diffusivity ratios equal to 1. The resin is assumed to be initially in C-form. In this case the film-model approximation coincides with the LDF approximation and, as expected, the predicted profiles are in reasonable agreement with those obtained from the numerical solution of the exact model, Eqs. 2-6. Figure 1(b) shows a comparison of the film-model prediction and the numerical solution of the exact model for diffusivity ratios [Dbar]A/[Dbar]B = 0.1 and [Dbar]A/[Dbar]B = 0.1. These ratios imply that A is the slowest counterion and C is the fastest. Since the resin is assumed to be initially in C-form, exchange of the faster counterions C and B occurs rapidly for short times. This causes an overshoot of the B average concentration in the particle above the final equilibrium value (0.5 in this case). For longer times, essentially all of the C is removed from the resin and counterdiffusion of A and B occurs slowly, being largely controlled by the low diffusivity of A. The results of the numerical solution of the exact model and those of the film model approximation are again in reasonable agreement, indicating that this approximation can be used as a simplified rate law for multicomponent ion-exchange calculations. Results for binary exchange were obtained previously by Carta et al. [7], and similar conclusions can be expected for systems with more than three counterions.

Figure 2 shows average resin loadings for the case of heterovalent exchange with z A = z c = 1, z B = 2, [Dbar]A/[Dbar]B = 11.4, and [Dbar]A/[Dbar]B = 0.0667. These values correspond to an experimental system considered by Yoshida and Kataoka [4] involving the exchange of Na+ (A), Zn2+ (B), and H+ (C) on a strong-acid cation exchanger. Figure 2(a) shows the results for a mixture of A and B displacing C, while Fig. 2(b) shows the results for a mixture of B and C displacing A. In both cases the solution of the film-model approximation and the numerical solution of the exact model are in satisfactory agreement. The latter, of course, is much simpler, requiring only the solution of a system of three ordinary differential equations. The numerical solution of the exact model is in good agreement with the results of Yoshida and Kataoka.

In the batch exchange the film model tends to underpredict the rate forshort times and to overpredict it for long times. This occurs because for short times the depth of penetration predicted by the exact model is less than the value r p/5 assumed by the film model. As time progresses, the depth of penetration predicted by the exact solution becomes greater than r p/5. On the average, however, the film model is in reasonable agreement with the exact solution. Figure 3(a) shows the breakthrough behavior in a fixed bed for the same system as in Fig. 1(a) assuming equal diffusivities, predicted using the film-model approximation and the exact model. Selectivity coefficients were assumed to be K B,A = K C,A = 0.333. The resin was assumed to be initially loaded with a mixture of A and C and is displaced by ion B. As expected from the LDF approximation, the film-model approximation is in good agreement with the numerical solution of the exact model. Figure 3(b) shows the same result for the case of diffusivity ratios [Dbar]A/[Dbar]B = 0.1 and [Dbar]A/[Dbar]B = 0.01 as in Fig. 1(b) In this case, as a result of the higher diffusivities of B and C, a sharper wave corresponding to the exchange of B and C ions is observed at short times. For longer times, when C is essentially completely eluted from the bed, the exchange of A and B continues to occur at a slow rate, giving rise to shallow effluent profiles. As seen in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the agreement between the film model and the exact solution for the fixed bed is, in fact, better than in the batch. This is because, during the development of the mass transfer zone in the resin bed, the overprediction of the exchange rates by the film model at the upstream end of the column (comparable to long times in the batch system) compensates for the underprediction of the exchange rates at the downstream end of the column (comparable to short times in the batch system). Thus, the effluent concentration given by the film model is in substantial agreement with the exact solution at all times and appears to capture quantitatively the effect of electrical coupling of the diffusion fluxes while providing a computationally simple rate law.

CONCLUSIONS A new approximate rate equation has been obtained for multicomponent ion exchange. The approximation is based on an equivalent film-resistance model. When used to predict batch uptake kinetics and fixed-bed ion-exchange behavior, this model is shown to provide results of accuracy comparable to that obtained when using the classical LDF approximation for systems with constant diffusivity. While the agreement of the film-model approximation and the exact numerical solution is not perfect, in general the results are deemed to be of sufficient accuracy for practical fixed-bed calculations, especially in view of the significant simplification of the computational effort which is afforded by using the new approximate rate equation.

Molecular dynamics simulations show that protein partitioning into the polymer-filled pore space increases with the overall charge content of the polymers, while the diffusivity in the pore space decreases. However, the combination of greatly increased partitioning and modestly decreased diffusion results in macroscopic transport rates that increase as a function of charge content, as the large concentration driving force due to enhanced pore space partitioning outweighs the reduction in the pore space diffusivity. Matrices having greater charge associated with the grafted polymers also exhibit more diffuse intraparticle concentration profiles during transient adsorption. In systems with a high charge content per polymer and a low protein loading, the polymers preferentially partition toward the surface due to favorable interactions with the surface-bound protein. These results demonstrate the potential of multiscale modeling to illuminate qualitative trends between molecular properties and the adsorption equilibria and kinetic properties observable on macroscopic scales.IntroductionARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToIon-exchange chromatography (IEC) is frequently used for protein purification in the production of biopharmaceuticals. (1) The technique can be used to separate a mixture of proteins based on the unique electrostatic interaction between each component and an oppositely charged adsorbent. Traditional \u201cmacroporous\u201d IEC adsorbents consist of porous particles with open pores and charged ligands attached to the pore surfaces. (2, 3) More recently, composite \u201cpolymer-grafted\u201d materials have been developed with the aim of combining the high mechanical strength of rigid particles and the desirable adsorption properties of charged hydrogels. (4-8) These adsorbents contain charged polymers grafted within the pore structure, which are thought to provide dynamic adsorption sites either in addition to or in lieu of those associated with ligands on the pore surface. The inclusion of charged polymers can allow for multilayers of bound protein, (7, 9) as opposed to macroporous media in which typically only monolayer adsorption is possible. (10) Depending on the identity and length of the polymer grafts, the structure within the particle pores can resemble a polymer brushlike layer on the surfaces with an open interior pore space, random coil structures that extend further into the pore (with single or multiple attachment points), or a hydrogel-like environment that fills the entire pore space. (10) The polymers can be based on charged monomers or electrically neutral monomers that are functionalized with charged ligands after grafting.Previous studies have shown that protein adsorption properties can be enhanced by the inclusion of charged polymer grafts. Stone and Carta synthesized agarose-based cation-exchange particles with functionalized dextran polymers incorporated into the pores. For certain proteins and salt concentrations, these materials provided a higher binding capacity and effective pore diffusivity than were observed in macroporous materials with the same backbone matrix and ligand type. (6, 11) In some cases, the effective pore diffusivity in the dextran-grafted materials even exceeded the protein diffusivity in free solution. Bowes and co-workers also observed enhanced adsorption capacities and kinetics in the commercial dextran-grafted materials SP Sepharose XL and Capto S versus a commercial macroporous material with a similar backbone, SP Sepharose Fast Flow. (7, 12) Charged polymers have also been grafted into the pore structure of macroporous monolithic polyacrylamide cryogels (13) and microporous membranes (9, 14) to enhance the protein binding capacities of these materials. Additionally, various polymers have been grafted onto surfaces to reduce nonspecific protein adsorption for both protein chromatography (15) and other biomedical applications. (16) Molecular mean-field modeling on these types of systems has shown that the amount of surface adsorption at equilibrium depends on the free energy cost of protein deforming the polymer layer and the free energy gain of adsorption onto the surface (17) and that properties of the polymer grafts can be tuned to control surface adsorption and desorption rates. (18)Various studies have shown that protein adsorption in polymer-grafted materials can depend significantly on the polymer graft density, the charge content of the adsorbent, and the salt concentration. For example, Bowes et al. found that while dextran-grafted matrices generally provided high equilibrium binding capacities at low salt conditions, large proteins were almost completely excluded from the dextran layer at high salt conditions, leading to low capacities. (7) In another study, Bowes and Lenhoff showed that increasing the overall charge content in a dextran-grafted adsorbent increased the binding capacity and affinity of lysozyme but also led to longer particle saturation times. (19) Increasing the dextran graft density for a constant charge content did not lead to clear trends in these properties for lysozyme. Lactoferrin did not show consistent trends with respect to either ligand or dextran density. (19) Instead, this larger protein appeared to be sterically excluded from the dextran polymers at high salt concentrations unless the ligand density was sufficiently high.Yu et al. studied the adsorption of bovine serum albumin on various anion exchangers in which poly(ethylenimine) was incorporated into Sepharose Fast Flow particles at different graft densities to achieve different overall charge densities. (20) They found that a critical charge density existed at which both the binding capacity and effective diffusivity increased significantly. For the same type of resin, \u03b3-globulin exhibited a maximum effective diffusivity at an intermediate charge density. (21) These results suggest that protein properties such as size and charge also affect the extent to which the polymer grafts enhance adsorption.While these studies demonstrate that molecular characteristics impact macroscopically observable properties such as the adsorption capacity and effective diffusivity, they do not reveal the underlying mechanisms. A better understanding of these molecular-level phenomena and how they affect macroscopic observables would be useful in the design and selection of polymer-grafted adsorbents that can provide high capacities and mass transfer rates for future separation problems.Previous molecular modeling studies have provided insights into mechanisms for protein diffusion and partitioning in polymer-grafted IEC systems and how this behavior varies with respect to system variables. Riccardi and co-workers have used MD simulations that include both atomistic and coarse-grained (CG) models with an explicit solvent to study the transport of a biomolecule through a matrix of charged dextran grafts. Among their findings are that the adsorbate gradually forms multivalent interactions with the dextrans and in the process partially blocks local pores within the polymer layer (22) and that lower dextran graft densities lead to larger polymer layer pore sizes and a relatively small gradient of local nonelectroneutrality due to the distribution of the charged ligands, both of which can affect transport through the polymers. (23) Johansson and Van Alstine studied similar systems with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations based on highly coarse-grained models. (24) Their simulations showed that protein adsorption onto charged polymer grafts was dependent on the salt concentration and protein surface charge density but was relatively independent of the polymer graft density. These studies have suggested mechanisms by which charged polymers can affect an individual adsorbate\u2019s partitioning and transport. However, larger ensembles of molecules should be considered in order to predict adsorption properties observable on macroscopic scales based on a system\u2019s molecular characteristics.To this end, we have recently developed a multiscale modeling approach for studying protein adsorption equilibria and kinetics in systems with various molecular properties. The approach is multiscale in the sense that it includes molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which is used to measure protein partitioning and diffusivities in different regions of the adsorbent pore, as well as numerical simulation of mass transfer into a particle, which is based on parameters measured from MD simulations and used to predict the effective transport rate. In our previous work, (25) we showed that lysozyme\u2019s transport rate in a polymer-grafted system under favorable binding conditions is faster than the rate predicted for ordinary pore diffusion, in agreement with experimental observations. (6) Our simulations showed this behavior could be explained by favorable partitioning into the polymer-filled pore space combined with relatively fast diffusion within the polymers.The overall goal of this work is to study in a systematic way how the properties of charged polymer grafts and the bulk solution affect a protein\u2019s adsorption and transport on both the molecular and macroscopic levels. The model IEC system is composed of dextran polymers functionalized with sulfonate groups and grafted to a macroporous agarose matrix, with lysozyme as the protein. We extend the modeling approach introduced previously to systems with different polymer charge content, graft density, and strength of electrostatics to predict how these variables qualitatively affect the protein\u2019s partitioning and diffusion within the pore, its effective transport rate, and the structure of the grafted polymers.MethodsARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Molecular Model DetailsMD simulations of an ensemble of lysozyme protein molecules within a dextran-grafted agarose matrix are used to determine protein partitioning and diffusion in different regions of the pore. Figures 1a and 1b show snapshots from simulations of adsorbents with different polymer graft densities and protein loadings that correspond to near-saturation conditions at equilibrium.Figure 1Figure 1. Snapshots from equilibrated MD simulations of lysozyme within an adsorbent pore. The dextran graft density corresponds to the estimated graft density of the experimental material, \u03c3e, in (a) and 3\u03c3e in (b). Both adsorbents are near saturation. Lysozyme, dextran, and sulfonate ligands (attached both to the surface and to the dextran) are shown in blue, green, and pink, respectively.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideOur molecular models have an intermediate level of coarse-graining compared to previous simulation studies on protein adsorption in charged polymer-grafted systems. For instance, we use a CG protein model with a higher resolution structure and charge distribution than the cubic lattice model of Johansson and Van Alstine, in which the protein is represented as a sphere with its net charge placed in its center. (24) Higher resolution of these molecular properties will be required to eventually study how adsorption and diffusion behaviors may vary for different protein species. However, our coarse-graining approach and implicit representation of the solvent provide less detail than the models used by Riccardi and co-workers. (22, 23) We hypothesize that the factors controlling adsorption and transport of an ensemble of protein molecules in the charged polymer-grafted pore involve only larger scale molecular properties such as charge distribution and protein flexibility. Therefore, we employ simpler CG models in order to efficiently study a multidimensional variable space with large-scale simulations. Relatively long time scales and large systems with multiple protein and polymer molecules are required to measure protein concentrations and diffusivities with sufficient precision to compare to experiments.The most important aspects of the coarse-graining procedure are described here, while full details are provided in the Supporting Information. The protein model is designed to approximate the charge distribution, excluded volume, and structural flexibility of lysozyme. Each protein molecule is modeled as an elastic network of CG beads, with each bead representing the excluded volume, mass, and net charge of 5 or 6 contiguous residues. The average excluded volume and strength of the harmonic bonds in the elastic network model are parametrized such that the CG model exhibits a radius of gyration and structural RMSD from its crystal structure that are consistent with the same properties of an atomistic model for lysozyme in explicit water.The agarose backbone of the adsorbent pore is modeled with two flat surfaces at the bottom and top of the simulation box, each represented by a uniform purely repulsive Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. The surfaces are separated by a distance of 21 nm, typical of the pore diameter of physical agarose matrices as measured by inverse size-exclusion chromatography (iSEC). (6) Sulfonate ligands on the surfaces are modeled as particles with a charge of \u22121 and fixed coordinates. The particles are arranged laterally in a hexagonal close packing arrangement with a density of 49 particles per 100 nm2 and have a heterogeneous distribution of z positions relative to the bottom or top of the simulation box, to roughly approximate the effects of agarose surface structure on the diffusion of surface-bound protein. The basis for this ligand density and surface model is discussed in our previous work. (25)Each charged polymer graft is modeled as a chain of CG beads, with each bead representing either a neutral dextran monomer, with a charge of 0, or a monomer with a sulfonate ligand attached, with a charge of \u22121. All polymer beads have a mass and excluded volume that approximate these properties for a glucose molecule. Bonds between adjacent monomers are described by the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential. Each chain is composed of 250 monomers, which approximates the size of the 40 kDa dextran polymers used in the experimental material of interest. (6) Each chain is \u201cgrafted\u201d to the pore surface by fixing the position of its first monomer at the position of a surface ligand, which is removed. The fixed monomers are arranged laterally in a hexagonal close packing arrangement. The separation between each fixed monomer and its nearest neighbors is determined by the graft density, \u03c3 = nchains/S, where nchains is the number of polymer chains on a pore surface and S is the pore surface area. The charge content per polymer chain, fPL, is simply defined as the fraction of charged monomers. The simulation box includes a void volume adjacent to the pore, which is accessible to the protein but not to the charged polymers. This void allows convenient measurement of the protein concentration in bulk solution in equilibrium with the adsorbent pore. Further details on system dimensions are given in the Supporting Information.Nine different adsorbents are tested in this study, with fPL values of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 and \u03c3 values of 1, 2, and 3 times the estimated graft density of the experimental material, \u03c3e. (6) A polymer charge content of fPL = 0.05 is believed to be most consistent with the experimental material, assuming that the dextran chains have approximately 5% side chain branching (26) and that each side chain branch is functionalized. (6) Thus, the system with fPL = 0.05 and \u03c3 = \u03c3e is most consistent with previous experiments and is used as our reference case. Our previous work showed that this system led to a ratio of effective pore diffusivity to free solution diffusivity of De,app/D0 = 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 for lysozyme under favorable binding conditions (with \u03b5r = 10), in qualitative agreement with experimental observations under low salt conditions. (6, 25) In this study, the concentration of polymer-bound ligand, cPL, ranges from 4 \u00d7 10\u20136 mol/mL for the reference case to 51 \u00d7 10\u20136 mol/mL for the most highly charged system with fPL = 0.2 and \u03c3 = 3\u03c3e. The concentration of surface-bound ligands is approximately 58 \u00d7 10\u20136 mol/mL for all systems.The system is evolved over time with the Langevin equation of motion using a temperature coupling strength, \u03c4T, that maintains the system\u2019s average temperature at T = 300 K. In simulations used to measure adsorption equilibria, \u03c4T = 100 ps, as this relatively weak coupling accelerates the equilibration process. In simulations used to measure protein diffusivities, \u03c4T = 0.7 ps, in order to approximate the viscous effects of a fictitious solvent on protein dynamics. (27) Electrostatic interactions are described by a modified Coulombic potential, with a dielectric constant \u03b5r applied to charged interactions separated by r < rCoulomb, where rCoulomb is 2.58 times the average radius of a CG protein bead. A constant dielectric environment is assumed for charged interactions at distances beyond rCoulomb. The inner dielectric is set to \u03b5r = 10 or \u03b5r = 15 to model relatively strong or weak binding conditions, respectively, corresponding to low or high ionic strengths. All MD simulations were performed using GROMACS version 4.6.4. (28)Although our CG models are significant approximations to the physical systems, their use for studying how molecular details qualitatively affect adsorption and diffusion is justified by the properties of the physical IEC systems. Because of the high hydrophilicity of the underlying agarose surface and the dextran polymers, protein adsorption is expected to be dominated by electrostatic attraction to the charged ligands. Previous MD simulations have demonstrated the dominant role of electrostatics in protein adsorption onto a charged hydrophilic surface, which may perturb but not completely displace the water layers on the surface. (29) Therefore, the free energy of desolvation associated with protein adsorption, which is not considered in these implicit solvent simulations, should not affect the qualitative trends we observe in protein partitioning with respect to adsorbent charge content and the strength of electrostatics. We note that this approach would not be appropriate for modeling hydrophobic interaction or mixed-mode chromatography systems, as the entropy increase associated with water moving from the protein interface to the bulk would be dominant for these cases. (30)Another important approximation made in this work is modeling the screening of charged interactions with a modified Coulombic potential rather than with explicit ions. This approach is justified for our systems because the IEC adsorption experiments that we are modeling are conducted in a range of relatively low ionic strengths (below 200 mM NaCl). (11) At low salt concentrations, counterions screen electrostatics by interacting directly with charged solutes, and only at higher concentration do they compete with solutes for interfacial water. (31) Therefore, we approximate their effects by simply scaling electrostatic interactions by the dielectric \u03b5r, as described above. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the parameters \u03b5r = 10 and \u03b5r = 15 lead to relatively high and low levels of protein adsorption, respectively. These parameters also lead to very similar equilibrium polymer structures in the absence of protein. At very high salt concentrations in which no protein binding occurs, the polymers are expected to collapse somewhat due to reduced repulsion between charged ligands. (6) However, it is not clear whether the charged dextrans modeled here would exhibit significantly different conformations for weak versus strong binding conditions or similar structures as predicted by our simulations. Finally, we note that modeling cooperative properties between multiple proteins and polymers requires a trade-off between molecular detail, system size, and computational efficiency. The use of CG protein and polymer models and an implicit representation of the solvent and ions increases the computation speed by approximately 4 orders of magnitude versus atomistic simulations, (25) which allows us to study multiple large systems.ResultsARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Adsorption EquilibriaA series of MD simulations with different protein loadings are used to quantify the adsorption isotherms for a given system with a particular polymer charge content, graft density, and strength of electrostatics. The concentration of surface-bound protein on a particle volume basis, qs, is defined as qs = (\u27e8Ns\u27e9/S)mprotSv, where \u27e8Ns\u27e9 is the time-averaged number of protein molecules for which the separation between the protein center of mass and the nearest surface ligand is less than 3 nm. It was previously determined that 3 nm is an appropriate cutoff for distinguishing between lysozyme molecules bound to and free of the surface. (25)S is the area of the pore surface, and mprot is the protein molecular mass. Sv is the pore surface area per adsorbent volume, estimated as Sv = 2\u03b5p/rpore, which assumes an intraparticle porosity, \u03b5p, and idealized cylindrical pores with a uniform pore radius, rpore. Values of \u03b5p = 0.9 and rpore = 19 nm are used in this work to be consistent with experimental measurements for similar physical systems. (6)The concentration of protein within the pore but not bound to the surface (referred to henceforth as \u201cin the pore space\u201d) is defined as cp = (\u27e8Np\u27e9/S)mprotSv, where \u27e8Np\u27e9 is 1/2 the time-averaged number of protein molecules in the pore space, i.e., separated from the nearest surface ligand by 3 nm or more. The total concentration of adsorbed protein both on the surface and in the pore space is q\u0302 = qs + cp. Finally, the concentration of protein in free solution is defined as C = (\u27e8Nfree\u27e9/Vfree)mprot, where \u27e8Nfree \u27e9 is the time-averaged number of molecules in a control volume Vfree defined in the void region adjacent to the pore. Additional details on how Ns, Np, and Nfree are measured can be found in ref  27.A given simulation is considered converged when the pore space concentration, cp, reaches steady state, as this concentration generally exhibits the longest equilibration time due to the relatively slow kinetics of molecules moving from the polymers to the charged surface. Equilibrium values for qs, cp, and C are found by averaging each time series over a period of at least 480 ns after cp reaches steady state.Figure 2 shows predicted adsorption isotherms for representative systems, which demonstrate that increasing the charge content per polymer, the polymer graft density, and the strength of electrostatics all lead to greater protein partitioning into the pore space and higher overall capacities. The plots in the top row show the isotherms most often measured experimentally, in which the total adsorbed concentration, q\u0302, is given as a function of free solution concentration, C. The plots in the middle row show qs versus cp isotherms, which describe the local partitioning of protein between the polymer-filled pore space and the charged surface. These isotherms are fit with the following Langmuir model:(1)where qm,s is the saturation capacity of the surface and Ks is the equilibrium constant for surface adsorption. The plots in the bottom row show cp versus C isotherms describing partitioning between the free solution and the pore space, which are fit with the Langmuir model:(2)where cp,m is capacity of the polymer-filled pore space and cp,m is the equilibrium constant for partitioning into the pore space from the bulk. Curves fitted according to eq 1, eq 2, and the sum of these models are shown alongside the values predicted from MD simulation in the plots of the middle, bottom, and top rows, respectively, of Figure 2. Modeling the overall isotherm as the sum of the two local equilibrium relationships allows us to capture the increase in the adsorbed concentration at high solution concentrations due to the polymer grafts (discussed below). This effect could not be captured with a single Langmuir model, which describes a single saturation regime.The constancy of the qs versus cp isotherms shown in Figures 2e\u2013h (middle row) demonstrates that surface adsorption is fairly independent of the adsorbent properties. Therefore, differences in the overall capacities are primarily due to different levels of protein partitioning from solution into the polymer-filled pore space, seen in the cp versus C isotherms shown in Figures 2i\u2013l (bottom row).As seen in Figures 2i and 2j, as fPL is increased at a constant graft density of \u03c3 = \u03c3e, pore space partitioning becomes increasingly favorable. The effect is most significant when electrostatic interactions are strong (\u03b5r = 10), but even when electrostatics are weaker (\u03b5r = 15), increasing the per-polymer charge content to fPL = 0.2 leads to enhanced pore space partitioning. As seen in Figures 2k and 2l, increasing the polymer graft density at a constant per-polymer charge content of fPL = 0.05 leads to a moderate increases in cp (and as a result, q\u0302) at saturation when electrostatics are strong but no enhancement when electrostatics are weaker.Figure 3 shows the predicted saturation capacities of the entire pore, q\u0302max, the surface, qsmax, and the pore space, cpmax, for all systems tested with both \u03b5r = 10 and \u03b5r = 15. cpmax is evaluated from eq 2 at C = 2 mg/mL, qsmax is found from eq 1 at cp = cpmax, and q\u0302max = qsmax + cpmax. The statistical uncertainty in a given saturation capacity is estimated by a similar bootstrapping procedure as described previously, (25) in which for each of 1000 bootstrap repetitions, we construct a local isotherm by sampling from the time series of the concentrations, fit the resulting isotherm with the appropriate isotherm model, evaluate the saturation capacity, and calculate the standard deviation of the 1000 predicted saturation capacities to estimate the standard error in the mean saturation capacity. These estimated uncertainties are low compared to the mean values, as seen in the magnitude of the error bars plotted in the center of the bars. Tables S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information provide the numerical values plotted here.Figure 2Figure 2. MD simulations of lysozyme in various polymer-grafted adsorbents show that increasing the charge content per polymer, fPL, and the graft density of charged polymers, \u03c3, can enhance lysozyme\u2019s overall adsorption capacity when electrostatics are strong, due to increased protein partitioning into the pore space. Increasing fPL for a constant \u03c3 = \u03c3e (left columns) leads to greater partitioning into the pore space (bottom row) and a higher overall capacity (top row), particularly for \u03b5r = 10. Increasing \u03c3 for a constant fPL = 0.05 (right columns) has a more moderate effect on the pore space partitioning and the overall capacity when \u03b5r = 10 and no effect for \u03b5r = 15. Surface adsorption is generally independent of the polymer properties tested (middle row).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideAs shown in Figure 3a, extremely high overall capacities of over 400 and 500 mg/mL are predicted in systems with high fPL and \u03c3 values when electrostatics are strong. We note that while these calculations are based on an assumed porosity of \u03b5p = 0.9, the protein-accessible porosity may be substantially smaller in actual materials. This could lead to an overprediction of the adsorption capacities by the model; however, in this study qualitative differences between the systems are of more interest than quantitative predictions. Again, the enhancements in the overall capacity relative to the capacity of the reference system with fPL = 0.05 and \u03c3 = \u03c3e are due to the enhanced pore space capacities, which in some cases approach and even exceed the capacity of the surface despite the lower concentration of ligands attached to the polymers versus the surface.Partitioning of lysozyme into the pore space appears to be favored in adsorbents with more highly charged polymers and lower graft densities, as seen when comparing the pore space capacities of different systems with similar charge contents. To illustrate this effect, Figure 4 shows cpmax versus the concentration of polymer-bound ligand, cPL, for all systems. Both concentrations are given on a molar basis, and statistical uncertainties are smaller than the sizes of the plot symbols. When electrostatics are strong (\u03b5r = 10), cpmax increases nearly linearly with cPL. However, comparing the two systems with cPL \u2248 9 \u00d7 10\u20136 mol/mL and the two systems with cPL \u2248 17 \u00d7 10\u20136 mol/mL, higher cpmax values (and thus higher q\u0302max values) are observed in the systems with higher per-polymer charge content and lower graft density. When electrostatics are weaker (\u03b5r = 15), pore space partitioning is only enhanced significantly in systems with a per-polymer charge content of fPL = 0.2. At lower fPL values, increasing the graft density provides no increase in the overall adsorption, despite the associated increase in the pore\u2019s overall charge content.Figure 3Figure 3. MD simulations of lysozyme in polymer-grafted adsorbents predict that more highly charged adsorbents lead to higher total saturation capacities (a,d) due to greater partitioning of protein into the pore space (c, f) when electrostatics are strong (a\u2013c) and have less effect on adsorption capacities when electrostatics are weaker (d\u2013f). All concentrations shown have units of mg/mL.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe adsorption equilibria results predicted by MD are qualitatively consistent with several experimental trends. The prediction that, for a given overall charge content and under favorable binding conditions, increasing fPL leads to a higher cpmax than increasing \u03c3 agrees with adsorption experiments for lysozyme in matrices with different charge contents and dextran graft densities. (19) The simulations also show that the protein is distributed throughout the entire polymer-filled pore space, in agreement with experimental observations of multilayer binding in polymer-grafted systems. (7, 9) As expected for IEC systems, the simulations predict reduced levels of adsorption in all systems when electrostatics are weaker with \u03b5r = 15. Additionally, the prediction that increasing the graft density provides no additional lysozyme adsorption when \u03b5r = 15 is likely related to the experimental observation that larger proteins can be partially excluded from the pore space by grafted polymers under high salt conditions. (7)Figure 4Figure 4. MD simulations of lysozyme in polymer-grafted adsorbents predict that the pore space saturation capacity, cpmax, varies approximately linearly with the polymer ligand concentration, cPL, when electrostatics are strong (\u03b5r = 10). cpmax is less dependent on cPL when electrostatics are weaker (\u03b5r = 15), except when the charge content per polymer is high.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint Slide Molecular DiffusivitiesFor each system, the average molecular diffusivities of the protein in different phases are determined from a single simulation with a loading corresponding to an equilibrium solution concentration between C = 1 and 3 mg/mL, which corresponds to a nearly saturated adsorbed phase. The diffusivity of a single protein molecule over a given time window, D, is measured based on the molecule\u2019s mean-squared displacement using the Einstein relationship, 2\u0394tD = (1/Ndim)\u27e8|ri(t + \u0394t) \u2013 ri(t)|2\u27e9, where ri is the center of mass coordinates, \u0394t is the offset time, and the braces denote averaging over multiple reference times t. As discussed in ref  27, the mobility of surface-bound protein is restricted to the xy plane, while molecules in the pore space and in the void region exhibit isotropic diffusion. Thus, the average diffusivity of protein on the surface, Ds, is determined from the ensemble-averaged 2-dimensional MSD with Ndim = 2, while the average diffusivity of protein in the pore space, Dp, is determined from the average 3-D MSD with Ndim = 3. For most systems, Ds and Dp are measured from the MSD slopes from \u0394t = 30 to 60 ns; however, Dp for the reference system (fPL = 0.05 and \u03c3 = \u03c3e) is measured from the MSD slope from \u0394t = 5 to 10 ns, as this system exhibited a linear MSD over shorter time scales. (25) The standard error of the mean of Ds and Dp is estimated by bootstrapping the average MSD curves, with 50 bootstrap repetitions.Figure 5 shows the average pore space diffusivities, Dp, predicted from the MD simulations as a function of cPL. The results suggest that diffusion can be significantly hindered when the polymer ligand concentration is high, depending on the strength of electrostatics. When binding conditions are favorable (\u03b5r = 10), Dp is approximately inversely related to the charge content per polymer, fPL, for each tested graft density \u03c3. The dependence on graft density (for a given per-polymer charge content) is less clear, though diffusion generally is most hindered in the systems with \u03c3 = 3\u03c3e. The variation in Dp with respect to cPL reflects the increased prevalence of multivalent interactions between protein and the polymer at higher polymer ligand interactions, as these multivalent interactions hinder mobility to a greater extent. At very high cPL, protein\u2013protein interactions also contribute to the decrease in Dp due to the high local protein concentrations within the polymers.Pore space diffusivities are generally higher when \u03b5r = 15 than when \u03b5r = 10 due to the weaker protein\u2013polymer interactions when electrostatics are more highly screened. For this case, Dp appears to be controlled by the graft density for \u03c3 = 2\u03c3e and \u03c3 = 3\u03c3e and is independent of fPL. Only at the lowest tested graft density of \u03c3 = \u03c3e does Dp decrease significantly with respect to fPL. These results suggest that the degree to which diffusion is hindered by steric effects versus electrostatic attraction to the ligands depends on the screening of charged interactions.The average predicted surface diffusivities vary from Ds = (0.5 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u20139 to (1.2 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u20139 cm2/s for \u03b5r = 10 and from (3.9 \u00b1 1.8) \u00d7 10\u20139 to (7.1 \u00b1 2.8) \u00d7 10\u20139 cm2/s for \u03b5r = 15. As discussed in our previous work, Ds variations in this range have little impact on the overall transport rate for these systems, as transport is largely controlled by the partitioning and diffusion of protein within the pore space. (25)Figure 5Figure 5. MD simulations of lysozyme in polymer-grafted adsorbents predict that the average protein diffusivity in the pore space, Dp, decreases more significantly with respect to the polymer ligand concentration, cPL, when electrostatics are strong (\u03b5r = 10).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint Slide Adsorption KineticsThe effective transport rate of each system is determined from numerical simulation of mass transfer based on the molecular behaviors of the protein predicted from MD. In order to provide a comparison with practical systems, the following conservation equation and initial and boundary conditions are used to model transient adsorption into a spherical particle of radius R over time t and radial distance r:(3a)(3b)(3c)(3d)(3e)The function f(cp) represents the local equilibrium between protein on the surface and in the pore space, which is described by the Langmuir model given in eq 1. The boundary condition at r = R is calculated according to eq 2, using C equal to the protein concentration of the extra-particle bulk solution, C0, assumed to be constant at 2 mg/mL. All isotherm model parameters as well as Dp and Ds are determined from MD simulations.Equation 3a is expressed in terms of cp based on the qs versus cp relationship given in eq 1 and solved using the method of lines. (32) The particle-averaged protein concentration, q\u0305, is calculated at each time t, and the resulting uptake curve is fit with the analytical solution for batch adsorption when ordinary pore diffusion is the mass transfer mechanism to estimate the apparent effective pore diffusivity, De,app, as described in the Supporting Information. De,app is defined as the pore diffusivity that would give the same adsorption kinetics as obtained experimentally for a macroporous adsorbent with a rectangular adsorption isotherm and conditions where qs \u226b cp. (6) The statistical uncertainty in De,app is estimated as the standard deviation of the De,app values predicted from 50 bootstrap repetitions. The isotherm parameters and diffusivities used for each repetition are randomly selected from their respective distributions of bootstrap samples, generated as discussed in the previous sections. The ratio De,app/D0 provides a measure of the overall transport rate, as it shows the degree to which protein diffusion is enhanced or hindered in the adsorbent relative to diffusion in free solution.Figure 6 shows the predicted De,app/D0 values as a function of cPL for both \u03b5r = 10 and \u03b5r = 15. The transport rate generally increases with respect to the charge content of the adsorbent when electrostatics are strong (\u03b5r = 10). Thus, according to the model, the decrease in Dp with respect to cPL seen in Figure 5 is outweighed by the increased capacity of the polymers as their overall charge content increases, as seen in Figure 4. This can be understood by recognizing that De,app/D0 is approximately proportional to the product of the adsorbed concentration and the diffusivity of adsorbed protein. (33) One exception to this trend of an increase in the polymer capacity outweighing a reduction in Dp is seen comparing the system with fPL = 0.1 and \u03c3 = 2\u03c3e to the system with fPL = 0.2 and \u03c3 = \u03c3e, which have the same overall charge content. The system with higher graft density has a 40% higher De,app/D0, but in this case its relatively high Dp outweighs its lower polymer capacity. When electrostatics are weaker (\u03b5r = 15), systems with a high per-polymer charge content of fPL = 0.2 exhibit enhanced transport rates that increase with respect to \u03c3, while the systems with lower fPL all exhibit relatively low transport rates. For the adsorbents with the highest cPL values, De,app/D0 at \u03b5r = 15 is comparable to or higher than the De,app/D0 values observed at \u03b5r = 10, as the relatively high diffusivities and low overall capacities when electrostatics are weak lead to fast saturation rates.The predicted trends that the transport rate and overall adsorption capacity both increase with the overall polymer charge content do not match previous experimental results showing that more highly charged adsorbents lead to higher capacities but slower uptake rates. (19) One reason for this discrepancy may be that the experimental systems are in a high ligand concentration regime in which the concentration of polymer-associated protein is high enough to cause steric hindrance, whereas our simulations have lower ligand concentrations based on design criteria described previously, (25) and thus lower polymer-associated protein concentrations. Additionally, no information is available on the distribution of charged ligands between grafted polymers and the underlying agarose surface in the actual experimental system. Differences in this distribution could affect adsorption capacities, binding strengths, and diffusion, resulting in different predicted trends. The model prediction that more highly charged polymers lead to faster transport is expected given the polymers\u2019 large positive effect on the concentration driving force and relatively small negative effect on protein diffusivities; however, it is likely that greater partitioning of ligands onto the surface would lead to slower transport rates under favorable binding conditions.Figure 6Figure 6. Mass transfer simulations of lysozyme in polymer-grafted adsorbents predict that the effective transport rate, De,app/D0, generally increases with respect to polymer ligand concentration, cPL, when electrostatics are strong (\u03b5r = 10). When electrostatics are weaker (\u03b5r = 15), De,app/D0 increases with respect to the graft density when the charge content per polymer is high.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideFigure 7 shows simulated intraparticle concentration profiles for the various systems, which illustrate how the charged polymer properties and strength of electrostatics can impact the pattern of adsorption into the particle. While for all systems, the concentration profile has a sharp front located at its maximum distance from the particle surface, the profiles for more highly charged adsorbents are relatively diffuse at shorter distances from the surface. This is most evident when electrostatics are strong (\u03b5r = 10) and to a lesser degree with weaker electrostatics. The diffuse profiles observed in the highly charged systems appear to correlate with the higher pore space concentrations and slower pore diffusivities for these same systems, shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.Diffuse intraparticle concentration profiles are typically associated with the solid diffusion mass transfer mechanism, in which the driving force is the concentration gradient of adsorbed protein. The ordinary pore diffusion mechanism leads to sharp concentration profiles and has a driving force of the concentration gradient of unbound protein in the pore space. (33) Previous confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments have shown that certain proteins exhibit sharp adsorption fronts in macroporous matrices and more diffuse fronts in particles with charged polymer grafts. (34) The profiles shown in Figure 7 suggest that the sharpness of the adsorption front in these polymer-grafted systems varies dependent on the relative amounts of protein bound to the underlying surface and polymers. For these systems, mass transfer may be best described by the \u201cpartial-shrinking core\u201d model used by Bowes and Lenhoff to describe uptake in commercial dextran-grafted materials. (12)Though beyond the scope of this study, the charge and size of the protein could also dictate the conditions under which increasing the per-polymer charge content and/or graft density enhances adsorption properties. Our simulations suggest that either type of polymer modification enhances enhances the pore space partitioning and transport rate of lysozyme, a relatively small model protein. However, it is possible that only low polymer graft densities would enhance the adsorption properties of a more weakly charged and/or larger protein, as steric hindrance from the neutral polymer segments may become important in these cases.Figure 7Figure 7. Mass transfer simulations of lysozyme in polymer-grafted adsorbents predict that the adsorption front into the particle changes qualitatively with respect to adsorbent properties and the strength of electrostatics. Intraparticle concentration profiles evaluated at t = 10 s are shown for all systems tested. The more highly charged adsorbents exhibit more diffuse concentration profiles, particularly when electrostatics are strong (\u03b5r = 10).High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint Slide Polymer Phase PropertiesThe MD simulations were analyzed to determine the equilibrium partitioning of the charged polymers throughout the pore space. The different adsorbents exhibit similar polymer structures under saturation conditions but very different structures at low protein loadings. This is evident in Figures 8a and 8b, which show results at high and low loadings, respectively, for the average number density of dextran monomers normalized by the pore surface area, ND/S, with respect to z position in the pore. Binding conditions are favorable with \u03b5r = 10. Each curve is averaged over 1 \u03bcs of simulation data.Figure 8Figure 8. MD simulations of lysozyme in polymer-grafted adsorbents predict that the charged polymers generally exhibit a uniform distribution within the pore at high protein loadings and can partition toward the surface at low protein loadings. The number density of dextran monomers normalized by the pore surface area, ND/S, relative to the z position within the pore, is shown for each adsorbent for both high (a) and low (b) protein loadings, with strong electrostatics (\u03b5r = 10). At high protein loadings leading to saturation, all adsorbents have similarly uniform polymer densities. At low protein loadings, the polymers in adsorbents with intermediate and high fPL values partition away from the pore interior and toward the pore surfaces due to favorable interactions with surface-bound protein.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideIn Figure 8a, the loadings are such that each adsorbent is near saturation conditions, with an equilibrium solution concentration of C \u2248 2 mg/mL. The distribution of polymers in the interior of the pore space is relatively uniform for all systems. The low number densities at low and high z positions reflect the presence of surface ligands and surface-bound protein that prevent the polymers from accessing these regions of the pore. The different magnitudes of the three groups of curves reflect the three graft densities tested. For each graft density, increasing the polymer charge content beyond fPL = 0.05 leads to slight peaks in the number density at intermediate z positions of approximately 5 and 23 nm, which exceed the number density in the pore interior by 20\u201340%. These deviations from a uniform distribution result from favorable interactions between the moderately and highly charged polymers with surface-bound protein.In Figure 8b, the protein loadings in each system are sufficiently low that all protein is bound to the surface, which has a concentration between qs = 170 and 220 mg/mL. Under these conditions the polymer number density deviates more significantly from a uniform distribution when the charge content per polymer exceeds fPL = 0.05. In these systems, the polymers have a strong preference for the pore surface relative to the interior of the pore due to interactions with the oppositely charged protein on the surface and the absence of protein in the pore. In the adsorbent with fPL = 0.2 and \u03c3 = \u03c3e, the interior pore space is completely devoid of polymers due to this effect. When electrostatic interactions are weaker (\u03b5r = 15), polymer partitioning to the pore surfaces at low loadings is less pronounced but still evident for highly charged adsorbents.Figure 9 shows how changes in the polymer structure with respect to protein loading are governed by the local concentrations of protein on the surface and in the pore space. For simulations of the system with fPL = 0.2, \u03c3 = \u03c3e, and \u03b5r = 10 with different loadings (represented by different colors), ND/S versus z is plotted as a function of the local concentrations qs and cp in Figures 9a and 9b, respectively. At a low loading that leads to qs < 100 mg/mL and cp = 0, the polymers exhibit a uniform distribution throughout the interior of the pore. Moderately higher loadings lead to increases in qs while the pore space concentration remains at cp = 0, due to the greater affinity of protein for the surface versus the polymers. This in turn causes the polymers to partition away from the pore interior and toward the surfaces where they can interact with the adsorbed protein. Finally, at higher protein loadings leading to cp > 0, the polymers return to the interior of the pore, eventually reaching a near-uniform distribution under saturation conditions. At these high loadings, there is a sufficient number of protein molecules in the pore space to attract the polymers to this region.As shown Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, when electrostatics are weaker (\u03b5r = 15), the polymers also exhibit some preference for the surface at intermediate loadings; however, the interior pore space is never devoid of polymer. This reflects the weaker affinity of the polymers for surface-bound protein when electrostatics are highly screened.Figure 9Figure 9. MD simulations of lysozyme in polymer-grafted adsorbents predict that the local protein concentrations within the pore can significantly affect the structure of the charged polymers when electrostatic interactions are strong. For the system with fPL = 0.2 and \u03c3 = \u03c3e and \u03b5r = 10, the polymer number density normalized by pore surface area, ND/S, with respect to z position is plotted as a function of qs (a) and cp (b). At a low protein loading the polymers exhibit a uniform distribution in the pore interior. At intermediate loadings the polymers partition away from the interior and toward the pore surface due to favorable interactions with surface-bound protein and the absence of protein in the pore interior. At higher loadings the polymers exhibit a more uniform distribution due to favorable interactions with protein in the pore space when the surface is nearly saturated.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe observation that protein diffusivities in the pore space are relatively constant with respect to protein loading justifies the use of a two-phase mass transfer model despite the observed inhomogeneities in the polymer structure under certain conditions. For the system with fPL = 0.2, \u03c3 = \u03c3e, and \u03b5r = 10 discussed above, diffusivities were measured at loadings of N = 250, in which the polymers completely collapse onto the protein-covered surface, N = 300, in which the polymers are attracted to surface-bound protein but extend somewhat into the pore space, and N = 320, in which the polymers exhibit a uniform distribution throughout the pore space. Dp values of (0.37 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10\u20136, (0.31 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10\u20136, and (0.31 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u20136 cm2/s were measured in these respective systems. The similarity of these results suggests that the two-phase transport model employed in this work, in which protein molecules are either on the surface or in the pore space, is appropriate. According to our model, accounting for slight deviations in Dp with respect to polymer structure would have only a very small effect on the predicted adsorption kinetics. However, it is possible that variations in the polymer structure at low loadings could impact the stability of the adsorbed protein, as a recent experiment has shown that for a monoclonal antibody adsorbed on a polymer-grafted cation-exchange resin, an increasing fraction of the bound protein becomes unfolded over time at low protein loadings. (35)ConclusionsARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToMultiscale modeling is employed to study how protein adsorption onto polymer-grafted IEC adsorbents varies with the charge content per polymer, the polymer graft density, and the strength of electrostatics. Differences in the predicted adsorption capacities for the various systems are driven by different degrees of protein partitioning into the polymer-filled pore space. In general, when electrostatics are strong, pore space partitioning and the effective transport rate both vary approximately linearly with the overall charge content of the polymers, while diffusion in the pore space decreases with respect to the overall charge content. More highly charged systems also lead to more diffuse intraparticle concentration profiles. In systems with a high per-polymer charge content and a relatively low protein loading, the polymer grafts preferentially partition toward the surface due to favorable interactions with surface-bound protein. The predicted adsorption equilibria results compare favorably with previous experiments showing that increasing the charge content of a polymer-grafted particle can lead to higher capacities and that the polymers can partially exclude protein from the pore under weak binding conditions.These results suggest that highly charged polymer-grafted systems can substantially enhance a protein\u2019s adsorption capacity and kinetics. For lysozyme, increasing the charge content per polymer and the polymer graft density both lead to comparable enhancements in adsorption properties, according to our model. However, the adsorption of other proteins might be more enhanced by manipulating only one material property, for example, if larger proteins were excluded from the adsorbent pore when the graft density was very high or the individual grafts were only weakly charged. Additional studies on how protein characteristics affect adsorption in polymer-grafted systems would help in designing adsorbents to achieve efficient separations of novel biological products.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToSection 1 describing details on the modeling approach; Tables S1 and S2 providing the local and total saturation capacities measured for each adsorbent, for strong and weak electrostatics, respectively; Figure S1 showing the polymer number density versus z measured at different local concentrations, for the case of weak electrostatics.

Biosepn. processes are dominated by chromatog. steps.  Even primary recovery is sometimes accomplished by chromatog. sepn., using a fluidized bed instead of a fixed bed.  In this review, the action principles, features of chromatog. media regarding phys. and chem. properties will be described.  An attempt will be made to establish categories of different media.  Characteristics for biosepn. are the large pores and particle sizes.  To achieve sufficient capacity for ultralarge mols., such as plasmids or nanoparticles, such as viruses monoliths are the media of choice.  In these media, the mass transport is accomplished by convection, and thus, the low diffusivity can be overcome.  Common to all modern chromatog. media is the fast operation.  There are examples where a residence time of less then 3 min, is sufficient to reach the full potential of the adsorbent. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXhtlajtbk%253D&md5=71532ef1cbaa0af03f261c05127d221b4Th\u00f6mmes, J.

The major limitations assocd. with conventional packed bed chromatog. for protein sepn. and purifn. can be overcome by using adsorptive microporous membranes as chromatog. media.  Microporous membranes have advantages as support matrixes in comparison to conventional bead supports because they are not compressible and they eliminate diffusion limitations.  As a result, higher throughput and shorter processing times are possible using these membrane systems.  In this paper, we review the current state of development in the area of attaching functionalized polymer brushes onto a microporous membrane to form a novel chromatog. medium for protein sepn. and purifn.  The functionalized polymer brushes were appended onto the pore surface of a microporous hollow-fiber membrane uniformly across the membrane thickness by radiation-induced graft polymn. and subsequent chem. modifications.  We review various applications of this adsorptive membrane chromatog. by focusing on polymer brushes bearing ion-exchange, hydrophobic and affinity groups.  Proteins were captured in multilayers by the ion-exchange group-contg. polymer brushes due to the formation of a three-dimensional space for protein binding via the electrostatic repulsion of the polymer brushes.  In contrast, proteins were captured in a monolayer at most by the polymer brushes contg. hydrophobic or affinity ligands.  By permeating a protein soln. through the pores rimmed by the polymer brushes, an ideal capturing rate of the proteins with a negligible diffusional mass-transfer resistance was achieved by the functionalized polymer brushes, based on ion-exchange, hydrophobic, and affinity interactions. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXktFCkur0%253D&md5=128f0b270c4722d97fb09baa9a1c9d2a10Lenhoff, A.

Anion-exchange polymer chains of poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (pDMAEMA) and poly([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]-trimethylammonium chloride) (pMETA), and cation-exchange polymer chains of polyacrylate have been grafted onto pAAm cryogels using potassium diperiodatocuprate as initiator.

The optimal controlled release is found from the interplay of electrostatic attractions at short distances from the surface and the proper electrostatic and steric repulsive barrier at distances from the surfaces larger than the proteins' size.  The implications of our results to the design of controlled-release devices is discussed. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XktFaisbY%253D&md5=23eff92759d24abf00148bf1ca6db94119Bowes, B.

However, these thermostatting algorithms alter the velocities of the particles and thus modify the dynamics of the system with respect to the microcanonical ensemble, which could potentially lead to thermostat-dependent dynamical artifacts.  In this study, we investigate how six well-established thermostat algorithms applied with different coupling strengths and to different degrees of freedom affect the dynamics of various mol. systems.  We consider dynamic processes occurring on different times scales by measuring translational and rotational self-diffusion as well as the shear viscosity of water, diffusion of a small mol. solvated in water, and diffusion and the dynamic structure factor of a polymer chain in water.  All of these properties are significantly dampened by thermostat algorithms which randomize particle velocities, such as the Andersen thermostat and Langevin dynamics, when strong coupling is used.  For the solvated small mol. and polymer, these dampening effects are reduced somewhat if the thermostats are applied to the solvent alone, such that the solute's temp. is maintained only through thermal contact with solvent particles.  Algorithms which operate by scaling the velocities, such as the Berendsen thermostat, the stochastic velocity rescaling approach of Bussi and co-workers, and the Nose-Hoover thermostat, yield transport properties that are statistically indistinguishable from those of the microcanonical ensemble, provided they are applied globally, i.e. coupled to the system's kinetic energy.  When coupled to local kinetic energies, a velocity scaling thermostat can have dampening effects comparable to a velocity randomizing method, as we observe when a massive Nose-Hoover coupling scheme is used to simulate water.  Correct dynamical properties, at least those studied in this paper, are obtained with the Berendsen thermostat applied globally, despite the fact that it yields the wrong kinetic energy distribution. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXnvVKhsbg%253D&md5=d3cd49b892dc363f4177d8eca8aaad3428Hess, B.; Kutzner, C.; van der Spoel, D.; Lindahl, E.

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decompn. algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel.

Anal. of six 20 ns trajectories performed at pH 7 and ionic strength 0.02 M (NaCl) reveals that conformational alterations are required for HEWL adsorption, and that upon adsorption the protein loses some \u03b1-helical content.  Simulations for a few different initial orientations show that the HEWL protein adsorbs on a flat surface with an angle between the protein long axis and the surface of about 45\u00b0.  The main adsorption site is located on the N,C-terminal part of the HEWL surface; the major role is played by Lys1, Arg5, Arg14, and Arg128.  Adsorption is not found with contrary orientations.  Two addnl. 20 ns trajectories calcd. with 0.5 M ionic strength suggest that the main force governing adsorption is electrostatic attraction between parts of the protein and the surface.  A trajectory obtained for the protein situated inside a cubic box built from the charged surfaces shows that the adsorption pattern is different for flat and nonflat surfaces, and in particular, adsorption on the nonflat surface requires tertiary structure alterations and partial unfolding.  The obsd. trends are consistent with both exptl. and previous computational studies. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXnt1WktLs%253D&md5=58836f583116a61c1362e9f8860fc22430Norde, W.

However the electro-chemical free energy of solvation of ions resides largely in the first two water layers, which control the interfacial behavior of the ions and require explicit modeling to capture their distinctive behaviors.  The resulting short range forces produce such surprising charge density-dependent behaviors as ion adsorption onto nonpolar surfaces, like charge aggregation of ions, and substantial ion pairing preferences, which arise largely from the affinity of specific ions for individual water molecules.  Specific ion effects controlled by the local water affinity of the ion show a diagnostic change of sign between strongly hydrated Na(+) and weakly hydrated K(+) and between strongly hydrated F(-) and weakly hydrated Cl(-), in both cases marking the strength of water-water interactions in bulk solution, a critical benchmark missing from continuum electrostatics models. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BC38nksFeqtA%253D%253D&md5=15020d1864787e396e7d38232e6ea69b32Schiesser, W.

Increasing fPL for a constant \u03c3 = \u03c3e (left columns) leads to greater partitioning into the pore space (bottom row) and a higher overall capacity (top row), particularly for \u03b5r = 10. Increasing \u03c3 for a constant fPL = 0.05 (right columns) has a more moderate effect on the pore space partitioning and the overall capacity when \u03b5r = 10 and no effect for \u03b5r = 15.

At high protein loadings leading to saturation, all adsorbents have similarly uniform polymer densities. At low protein loadings, the polymers in adsorbents with intermediate and high fPL values partition away from the pore interior and toward the pore surfaces due to favorable interactions with surface-bound protein.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideFigure 9Figure 9.

At a low protein loading the polymers exhibit a uniform distribution in the pore interior. At intermediate loadings the polymers partition away from the interior and toward the pore surface due to favorable interactions with surface-bound protein and the absence of protein in the pore interior. At higher loadings the polymers exhibit a more uniform distribution due to favorable interactions with protein in the pore space when the surface is nearly saturated.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideReferencesARTICLE SECTIONSJump To\n            This article references 35 other publications.\n        1Cramer, S.

Dramatic improvements in cell culture titers, product quality constraints, new regulatory directives and the emergence of biosimilars have necessitated the development of more efficient downstream bioprocesses for biopharmaceuticals.  This has resulted in significant improvements in traditional sepn. processes as well as the emergence of entirely new approaches.  In this review, we highlight some of these recent advances.  This includes chromatog. phases with elevated capacities and unique selectivities, new classes of monoliths and membrane adsorbers for the recovery of large bioproducts, high resoln. membrane systems for polishing operations, continuous downstream processes for multicomponent sepns., affinity tags with self-cleaving inteins, responsive biopolymers for single step sepns., the implementation of high throughput process development and designing proteins for biomanufacturability. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhsVynsrjK&md5=18d16202f8696e3869e51c5711f1e09e2Boschetti, E.

Biosepn. processes are dominated by chromatog. steps.  Even primary recovery is sometimes accomplished by chromatog. sepn., using a fluidized bed instead of a fixed bed.  In this review, the action principles, features of chromatog. media regarding phys. and chem. properties will be described.  An attempt will be made to establish categories of different media.  Characteristics for biosepn. are the large pores and particle sizes.  To achieve sufficient capacity for ultralarge mols., such as plasmids or nanoparticles, such as viruses monoliths are the media of choice.  In these media, the mass transport is accomplished by convection, and thus, the low diffusivity can be overcome.  Common to all modern chromatog. media is the fast operation.  There are examples where a residence time of less then 3 min, is sufficient to reach the full potential of the adsorbent. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXhtlajtbk%253D&md5=71532ef1cbaa0af03f261c05127d221b4Th\u00f6mmes, J.

The major limitations assocd. with conventional packed bed chromatog. for protein sepn. and purifn. can be overcome by using adsorptive microporous membranes as chromatog. media.  Microporous membranes have advantages as support matrixes in comparison to conventional bead supports because they are not compressible and they eliminate diffusion limitations.  As a result, higher throughput and shorter processing times are possible using these membrane systems.  In this paper, we review the current state of development in the area of attaching functionalized polymer brushes onto a microporous membrane to form a novel chromatog. medium for protein sepn. and purifn.  The functionalized polymer brushes were appended onto the pore surface of a microporous hollow-fiber membrane uniformly across the membrane thickness by radiation-induced graft polymn. and subsequent chem. modifications.  We review various applications of this adsorptive membrane chromatog. by focusing on polymer brushes bearing ion-exchange, hydrophobic and affinity groups.  Proteins were captured in multilayers by the ion-exchange group-contg. polymer brushes due to the formation of a three-dimensional space for protein binding via the electrostatic repulsion of the polymer brushes.  In contrast, proteins were captured in a monolayer at most by the polymer brushes contg. hydrophobic or affinity ligands.  By permeating a protein soln. through the pores rimmed by the polymer brushes, an ideal capturing rate of the proteins with a negligible diffusional mass-transfer resistance was achieved by the functionalized polymer brushes, based on ion-exchange, hydrophobic, and affinity interactions. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXktFCkur0%253D&md5=128f0b270c4722d97fb09baa9a1c9d2a10Lenhoff, A.

Anion-exchange polymer chains of poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (pDMAEMA) and poly([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]-trimethylammonium chloride) (pMETA), and cation-exchange polymer chains of polyacrylate have been grafted onto pAAm cryogels using potassium diperiodatocuprate as initiator.  It was possible to achieve the ion-exchange capacity up to 0.2-0.5 mmol/mL.  The graft polymn. did not alter the macroporous structure of the pAAm cryogel, however the flow rate of solutes through the cryogel matrix decreased with increase in the d. of polymer grafted.  The sorption of low-mol.-wt. (metal ion, dye) and high-mol.-wt. (protein) substances on the grafted monolithic pAAm column has been studied.  The results indicate that a 'tentacle'-type binding of protein to grafted polymer depended on the architecture of the grafted polymer layer and took place after a certain degree of grafting has been reached.  The binding of proteins by tentacle-like polymer chains allowed for increasing the binding capacity for proteins on the grafted pAAm cryogels up to 6-12 mg/mL. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XovVWltbo%253D&md5=d7487a2055b7823bd587a74c3ecb500f14Tsuneda, S.; Saito, K.; Furusaki, S.; Sugo, T.

The hydrophilic coating results in minimal interaction between the support and the biomol., while the highly flexible tentacular-like anion-exchange groups increase the ionic interaction potential and act as an umbrella to hold the proteins away from the surface.  Because of the removal of silanophilic interactions, minimization of hydrophobic interactions, and the highly flexible nature of the tentacle-like ion exchangers, ionic interactions can therefore dominate the sepn.  As such this phase is highly suited to the sepn. of highly charged biomols. and their variants.

However, these thermostatting algorithms alter the velocities of the particles and thus modify the dynamics of the system with respect to the microcanonical ensemble, which could potentially lead to thermostat-dependent dynamical artifacts.  In this study, we investigate how six well-established thermostat algorithms applied with different coupling strengths and to different degrees of freedom affect the dynamics of various mol. systems.  We consider dynamic processes occurring on different times scales by measuring translational and rotational self-diffusion as well as the shear viscosity of water, diffusion of a small mol. solvated in water, and diffusion and the dynamic structure factor of a polymer chain in water.  All of these properties are significantly dampened by thermostat algorithms which randomize particle velocities, such as the Andersen thermostat and Langevin dynamics, when strong coupling is used.  For the solvated small mol. and polymer, these dampening effects are reduced somewhat if the thermostats are applied to the solvent alone, such that the solute's temp. is maintained only through thermal contact with solvent particles.  Algorithms which operate by scaling the velocities, such as the Berendsen thermostat, the stochastic velocity rescaling approach of Bussi and co-workers, and the Nose-Hoover thermostat, yield transport properties that are statistically indistinguishable from those of the microcanonical ensemble, provided they are applied globally, i.e. coupled to the system's kinetic energy.  When coupled to local kinetic energies, a velocity scaling thermostat can have dampening effects comparable to a velocity randomizing method, as we observe when a massive Nose-Hoover coupling scheme is used to simulate water.  Correct dynamical properties, at least those studied in this paper, are obtained with the Berendsen thermostat applied globally, despite the fact that it yields the wrong kinetic energy distribution. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXnvVKhsbg%253D&md5=d3cd49b892dc363f4177d8eca8aaad3428Hess, B.; Kutzner, C.; van der Spoel, D.; Lindahl, E.

Anal. of six 20 ns trajectories performed at pH 7 and ionic strength 0.02 M (NaCl) reveals that conformational alterations are required for HEWL adsorption, and that upon adsorption the protein loses some \u03b1-helical content.  Simulations for a few different initial orientations show that the HEWL protein adsorbs on a flat surface with an angle between the protein long axis and the surface of about 45\u00b0.  The main adsorption site is located on the N,C-terminal part of the HEWL surface; the major role is played by Lys1, Arg5, Arg14, and Arg128.  Adsorption is not found with contrary orientations.  Two addnl. 20 ns trajectories calcd. with 0.5 M ionic strength suggest that the main force governing adsorption is electrostatic attraction between parts of the protein and the surface.  A trajectory obtained for the protein situated inside a cubic box built from the charged surfaces shows that the adsorption pattern is different for flat and nonflat surfaces, and in particular, adsorption on the nonflat surface requires tertiary structure alterations and partial unfolding.

However the electro-chemical free energy of solvation of ions resides largely in the first two water layers, which control the interfacial behavior of the ions and require explicit modeling to capture their distinctive behaviors.  The resulting short range forces produce such surprising charge density-dependent behaviors as ion adsorption onto nonpolar surfaces, like charge aggregation of ions, and substantial ion pairing preferences, which arise largely from the affinity of specific ions for individual water molecules.  Specific ion effects controlled by the local water affinity of the ion show a diagnostic change of sign between strongly hydrated Na(+) and weakly hydrated K(+) and between strongly hydrated F(-) and weakly hydrated Cl(-), in both cases marking the strength of water-water interactions in bulk solution, a critical benchmark missing from continuum electrostatics models. >> More from SciFinder \u00aehttps://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BC38nksFeqtA%253D%253D&md5=15020d1864787e396e7d38232e6ea69b32Schiesser, W.

The solution is used to define the effective rate coefficient, K, for the linear driving force (LDF) approximation for cyclic adsorption and desorption. The results obtained differ from those previously derived using an equivalent solid diffusion model for the pellet with a single diffusional time constant, approaching this limit only when macropore diffusion is dominant. In fact, for rapid-cycling the mass transfer rate cannot be expressed in the terms of a simple linear combination of the diffusional time constants for the bidisperse pellet independent of cycle time. Thus, in this case, the exact solution must be used to arrive at an appropriate representation of mass transfer rates in cyclic adsorption, which can be used for the simulation of sportive separations.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)Copyright \u00a9 1993 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

When the distribution coefficient between the fluid and the solid phases is different for the two components, the elution profiles are broadened to an extent that depends upon the rate of reaction. For low reaction rates, the two components behave independently and two separate peaks are obtained when an equilibrium mixture is injected. At intermediate reaction rates, the elution profiles are stretched between the characteristic elution times of the two components. Finally, at high reaction rates, the two components propagate through the column as an equilibrium mixture and two superimposed symmetrical peaks are obtained. The mathematical development is used in the analysis of experimental results for the chromatographic separation of glucose\u2014fructose mixtures at diferent temperatures. Each component peak is broadened and distorted by the simultaneous occurrence of mutarotation, which results in the formation of differently sorbed tautomers for each sugar. The model developed allows a determination of equilibrium and rate constants for each tautomer and a successful prediction of the chromatographic behavior.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Operated by Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy, under contract DE-AC05-84OR21400.Copyright \u00a9 1992 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

The rate expression approximates the electric field effects on intraparticle diffusion in spherical ion-exchangers. With regard to the prediction of batch exchange and column breakthrough curves for both irreversible and reversible processes, the model captures the essential traits of the coupled diffusion phenomenon described by the Nernst\u2013Planck equation with results of accuracy comparable to that obtained when using the linear driving force approximation for systems with constant diffusivity. Numerical results for the exchange of two counterions of equal valence are presented as application examples for different mobility ratios and selectivity coefficients.

For example, when using particulate adsorbent media in a fixed bed, rate expressions de-scribing intraparticle diffusion are obtained by writing transient conservation equations in spherical coordinates for the particles. These equations are, in turn, coupled to overall transient balances for the column through boundary conditions at the particle\u2013fluid interface, yielding a system of nonlinear partial differential equations in three independent variables: the column axis, the particle radius, and time. The resulting system of equations can be stiff because of the nonlinearity of the adsorption isotherm. Thus, it is often desirable to use simpler explicit expressions to represent the rate of interphase mass transfer. A popular choice is the so-called linear driving force (LDF) approximation, where the rate of interphase mass transfer is expressed as the product of a rate coefficient times a driving force written as a concentration difference. The LDF approximation was originally obtained by Glueckauf [1] for batch adsorption with a linear isotherm and a constant diffusivity. However, it is also often used to describe both batch and column adsorption processes even if the isotherm is nonlinear since it produces results which are typically qualitatively and often quantitatively correct [2]. The LDF approximation can be derived mathematically by assuming that the intraparticle concentration profile is parabolic [3]. When the intraparticle diffusivity,[Dbar], is constant, and the diffusion resistance in the adsorbed phase is dominant, the dimensionless intraparticle flux of an adsorbate species in a sorbent particle of radius r p and capacity q 0 is given by    where J * = r p J/[Dbar]q 0. y is the dimensionless solute concentration and \u03c1 is the dimensionless radial coordinate. If the concentration profile inside the particle is assumed to be parabolic, we have [3]:    where [ybar] is the average concentration in the sorbent particle and y * is the equilibrium concentration at the particle surface. The following rate equation is obtained by combining Eq. 2 with an overall mass balance for the particle:    where \u03c4=[Dbar]t/r2 Px is a dimensionless diffusion time. For the exchange of two counterions A and B in an ion-exchange resin, the situation is further complicated by the electrical coupling of diffusion fluxes. When the mobilities of the exchanging ions are different, an electric field gradient is established during the exchange process giving rise to effective diffusivities that vary strongly with composition. In this case, for a counterion A of charge z A, the equivalent dimensionless flux can be expressed by the Nernst\u2013Planck equation 4:    where \u03b1=[Dbar]B/[Dbar]Ax is the ratio of the self-diffusivities of the two counterions, y A is the equivalent fraction in the exchanger phase, and \u03c6 is the electric potential. In this case the dimensionless flux is J * = r p J A/[Dbar]B q 0 where J A is the equivalent ion flux and q 0 is the exchanger capacity. Assuming zero current (J A + J B = 0), and that the equivalent ion concentration inside the exchanger remains constant (y A + y B = 1), the electric field can be eliminated, yielding the result [5]:    where \u03b7 = z B/z A. As discussed by Helfferich [4], this equation shows that as y A approaches unity, the controlling diffusivity becomes that of ion B. Conversely, as y A approaches zero, the controlling diffusivity becomes that of ion A. Considering, for example, a batch system, the exchange process tends to proceed faster when the ion initially in the exchanger is the one with higher diffusivity than when the ion initially in the exchanger has lower diffusivity. Numerical results obtained with this equation are given by Helfferich and Plesset [5] and Plesset et al. [6] for exchange on a single particle, and by Kataoka et al. [7] for irreversible ion exchange in columns under constant-pattern conditions. Approximations for these equations have been proposed by a few authors. Rendueles de la Vega et al. [8] proposed the use of a \u201ccorrected Fick diffusivity\u201d for equivalent binary exchange (\u03b7 = 1). In this approach the particle conservation equation (modeled assuming a slab geometry) is solved assuming a constant \u201ccorrected diffusivity\u201d value. The latter value, in turn, is obtained by matching the numerical solution of the constant-diffusivity model to the numerical solution of the Nernst-Planck model (also for a slab geometry) in such a way as to obtain consistent results. Following a different approach, Melis et al. [9] developed an extension of the LDF approximation which does not require solving a partial differential equation. In this approach the intraparticle concentration profile is assumed to be parabolic and the electric potential gradient is calculated accordingly using Eq. 4 with the condition of zero electric current. For reversible binary exchange, the result can be expressed as    where the dimensionless time is \u03c4 = [Dbar]Bt/r2 P. Comparing Eq. 6 with Eqs. 3 and 5, we see that the term (1 \u2212 \u03b7)y A * + \u03b7]/[(1 \u2212 \u03b7\u03b1)y A * + \u03b7\u03b1] is a correction factor to the classical LDF approximation that depends on the exchanger composition, y A *, at the particle\u2013fluid interface. Melis et al. [9] showed that this treatment, in general terms, provides a good approximation of the Nernst\u2013Planck model for an experimental system characterized by a moderate selectivity coefficient and moderate values of \u03b1. Because of the assumption made in deriving the model, however, it is expected that this approximation is likely not adequate for ion-exchange systems where the intraparticle concentration profiles are far from parabolic. This occurs when the interfacial concentration y A * approaches unity, i.e., for irreversible (or very favorable) exchange, when the diffusivity ratio \u03b1 is large 5-6. Thus, the objectives of this paper are twofold: 1. To develop a new approximate rate expression for binary ion exchange taking into account the electric field effect with validity for both small and large values of \u03b1.2. To test this approximation with regard to the prediction of batch exchange and column breakthrough curves for both irreversible and reversible exchange in comparison with the results predicted by the Nernst\u2013Planck model.   THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT  Nernst\u2013Planck Model Dimensionless conservation equations for the Nernst\u2013Planck model, assuming spherical particles and neglecting volume changes in the exchanger, can be written as                These equations are related to overall balances which may be written as follows.   For a batch system         where \u03bb = V r q 0/V s C 0.   For a column               where       The external mass transfer resistance is neglected in these equations. Thus, for an ideal system, y A * is related to the fluid-phase equivalent fraction in solution by the mass action law [4]:    Dimensional forms of these equations can be found in Ref. [10]. In general, a numerical solution is required unless \u03b7 = 1 and \u03b1 = 1. This was obtained by discretizing the particle conservation equation in the \u03c1-direction using the finite difference scheme of Kataoka et al. [7]. For the case of batch exchange, the resulting system of ordinary differential equations was integrated numerically together with Eq. 8 using subroutine DIVPAG in the IMSL library. For the case of exchange in a column, Eq. 9 was discretized in the axial direction by backward finite differences. In general this introduces numerical dispersion. However, in this case the number of axial discretization points was chosen sufficiently large so as not to affect significantly the accuracy of the numerical results. For the case of irreversible exchange, numerical approximations of the exact solution are given by Helfferich and coworkers 5-6 for a batch system and by Kataoka et al. [7] for constant-pattern breakthrough.   Film Model Approximation To develop this approximation we note that if one assumes that the intraparticle mass transfer resistance is represented by pseudosteady-state diffusion through a hypothetical flat film of thickness \u03b4 = r p/5, a result mathematically equivalent to the Glueckauf LDF approximation (Eq. 3) is obtained for the case of a constant diffusivity system. Using the same representation for binary ion exchange, and expressing the flux with Eq. 5, yields the following equation and boundary conditions:          Integrating Eq. 11a, 11b across the film and combining the result with an overall species balance for a spherical particle, the following film model approximation is obtained:    where    The term in brackets in Eq. 12 represents a correction factor for the classical LDF approximation accounting for the effect of the electric field. When \u03b1 = 1 (equal diffusivities), Eq. 12 reduces to Eq. 3. Analytic solutions for batch adsorption and for constant pattern breakthrough can be found solving Eq. 8 or 9 with Eq. 12 for the case of irreversible exchange (y A * = 1) when \u03b7 = 1, and are given below.   Film model solution for batch adsorption (y A * = 1, \u03b7 = 1)        Film model solution for irreversible constant pattern (y A * = 1, \u03b7 = 1)        In this case, for constant pattern [ybar]A =xA. Equation 14 contains an integration constant \u03b3 which is obtained from the material balance condition [10]:    This yields    Other cases with \u03b7 \u2260 1 (or for reversible exchange) are easily handled numerically as discussed previously. Equations 13 and 14 converge to the corresponding well-known results for constant diffusivity when \u03b1 \u2192 1; that is:    for batch adsorption, and    for constant pattern breakthrough [10]. It should be noted that if the intraparticle concentration profile is assumed to be parabolic, results identical to Eqs. 17 and 18 are obtained independently of the value of \u03b1 since that approximation yields [Dbar] =[Dbar]B = constant when y A * = 1.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Numerical results comparing the exact Nernst\u2013Planck model solution to the film model approximation are presented for different situations of potential practical interest for the case of equivalent exchange (\u03b7 = 1): 1) irreversible batch exchange, 2) reversible batch exchange and 3) breakthrough behavior with both irreversible and reversible exchange. In each case, time is rendered dimensionless using the diffusivity of the leaving ion B. Curves calculated assuming a parabolic concentration profile inside the particle are also shown for comparison. Figure 1 shows results for the case of irreversible batch exchange with a constant surface concentration y A * = 1. For each value of \u03b1, the film model solution underestimates the exchange rate for short times and overestimates the rate for long times. This deficiency is characteristic of the LDF approximation. On the other hand, the effect of the electric field, i.e., the variation of the curves with \u03b1, is correctly predicted. In accordance with the exact Nernst\u2013Planck solution, the rate is predicted to be faster when the faster ion is initially in the resin. In this case the assumption of a parabolic concentration profile would lead to a single curve independent of the value \u03b1 and coincident with the curve shown for the film model with \u03b1 = 1.

Resin initially in B-form. Display full size FIG. 1 Comparison of exact solution of Nernst\u2013Planck model and film model approximation for irreversible batch exchange with \u03b7 = 1. Resin initially in B-form.  Numerical results for reversible batch exchange are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for values of the selectivity coefficient K = 10 and K = 2. Values of x 0 A = 0.7 and \u03bb = 1 were chosen for both cases. Both figures give the solution composition as a function of time. Curves calculated assuming that the concentration profile inside the particle is parabolic are also shown. For K = 10 (Fig. 2), when \u03b1 < 1, assuming that the intraparticle concentration profile is parabolic, tends to underestimate the exchange rate. The film model solution is closer to the exact Nernst\u2013Planck model although, of course, it still underestimates the rate for short times and overestimates it for long times. For \u03b1 = 1, the film model and the solution obtained assuming a parabolic concentration profile coincide and both are in approximate agreement with the exact solution. As \u03b1 become greater than 1, however, the solution obtained assuming a parabolic concentration profile tends to overestimate the rate while the film model correctly predicts the general trend with regard to the effect of the electric field on the exchange rate. For values of K = 2 (Fig. 3), the equilibrium is less favorable and the interfacial concentration, y A *, attains lower values. In this case the intraparticle profiles retain a shape which is generally parabolic and, as a result, the solution obtained assuming a parabolic profile, as proposed by Melis et al. [9], compares favorably with the exact solution. The film model again provides an approximate prediction of the effect of the electric field and a qualitatively correct prediction of the shape of the x A vs \u03c4 curves for each value of \u03b1.

Resin initially in B-form.  A comparison of the different models for the case of irreversible constant pattern breakthrough is given in Fig. 4 for different values of \u03b1. In each case the effluent profiles are centered around the value \u03c4\u2032 \u2212 \u03be = 0. However, the slope decreases as the value of \u03b1 increases. The solution obtained using the diffusivity of the ion initially present in the resin as the controlling diffusivity is also shown for comparison. This solution is obtained when the intraparticle concentration profile is assumed to be parabolic. The film model, while not reproducing the exact solution precisely everywhere, approximates the effect of the electric field for each value of \u03b1. Similar results are obtained for the case of reversible exchange. These results were obtained by numerical integration and are shown in Fig. 5 for K = 10 and in Fig. 6 for K = 2. For values of \u03b1 of 1 or lower, the numerical results are nearly coincident independently of the value of K since, as noted by Kataoka et al. [7], the effect of the electric field is smaller when \u03b1 \u2264 1. When the exchange is highly favorable, however, as in the case of K = 10, as \u03b1 is increased the solution obtained assuming a parabolic concentration profile inside the particles becomes progressively worse since it tends to predict a dominance of the diffusivity of the leaving ion. Thus, a steeper breakthrough curve is predicted by this model. The film model solution, on the other hand, continues to follow the breakthrough curve obtained from the Nernst\u2013Planck model predicting quantitatively the effect of the electric field. As the exchange equilibrium becomes less favorable, as in the case of K = 2 shown in Fig. 6, the discrepancy between the different models becomes smaller. This occurs because the surface of the particle does not immediately attain a value of y A * approaching unity as in the case of irreversible or highly favorable exchange. Thus, in this case also the LDF correction factor obtained assuming a parabolic profile, as suggested by Melis et al. [9], provides a good approximation. It is worth noting that the film model appears to work well not only for constant-pattern or near constant-pattern conditions as shown in Fig. 4(a\u2013d), Fig. 5(a\u2013d), and in Fig. 6(a\u2013c), but also for nonconstant-pattern conditions as shown in Fig. 6(d).

CONCLUSIONS A rate expression for binary ion exchange, based on an equivalent pseudosteady-state film resistance model, approximates the effects of the electric field on intraparticle diffusion in spherical ion-exchanger particles. The model converges to the classical Glueckauf LDF approximation when the ions have equal diffusivity. When the diffusivities are different, however, the approximation contains a correction factor whose magnitude depends on the value of the diffusivity ratio, \u03b1, and the charge ratio, \u03b7, of the two counterions. Calculated batch uptake curves and breakthrough curves obtained using this correction factor for equivalent exchange and both irreversible and reversible exchange are in good agreement with exact calculations based on the Nernst\u2013Planck model for spherical particles. Thus, the equivalent film model appears to capture the essential traits of the coupled diffusion phenomenon in ion exchange, giving results of accuracy comparable to that obtained when using the LDF approximation for systems with constant diffusivity. The film model approximation should be useful for numerical calculations involving more complex equilibrium relationships and operating conditions where the intraparticle concentration profile cannot be approximated as a parabola. A disadvantage is that the extension to multicomponent systems is not straightforward, likely requiring the integration of a system of ODE's across the film. \nRelated Research Data\nFabrication of Ag2S/CdS Heterostructured Nanosheets via Self-Limited Cation ExchangeSource:\nWalter de Gruyter GmbH\nLinking provided by\u00a0\n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS One of the authors, G.C., was a Visiting Professor at the Universita di Cagliari during completion of this work.

The effects of radial compression on column back-pressure, peak shape, efficiency and column stability were studied for isocratic and gradient elution. The application of radial compression was found to be beneficial, allowing the column to be operated with efficiencies comparable to those obtained with analytical-scale equipment and stably over long periods of time.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1994 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Axial flow columns are used for POROS while the monolith has a radial flow configuration, which provides comparable operating pressures. The POROS beads contain a bimodal distribution of pore sizes, some as large as 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm, which allow a small fraction of the mobile phase to flow within the particles, while the monolith contains 1\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm flow channels. For proteins (lysozyme and IgG), the dynamic binding capacity of the POROS columns is more than twice that of the monolith at longer residence times. While the DBC of the POROS HS 50 column decreases at shorter residence times, the DBC of the POROS HS 20 column for IgG remains nearly twice that of the monolith at residence times at least as low as 0.2\u00a0min as a result of intraparticle convection. Protein recoveries are comparable for all three columns. For VLPs, however, the eluted peaks are broader and recovery is lower for the monolith than for the POROS columns and is dependent on the direction of flow in the monolith, which is attributed to denser layer observed by SEM at the inlet surface of the monolith that appears to trap VLPs when loading in the normal flow direction.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsPerfusion chromatographyMonolithsMass transferProteinsVirus-like-particlesRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current address: Bluebird Bio, 150 Second Street, Third floor, Cambridge, MA 02141, United States.View Abstract\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

New extracorporeal systems combining membrane and adsorbent technologies are being developed to replace critical liver detoxification functions between diagnosis and transplantation. This study addresses the adsorption of representative plasma components on four different hydrophobic, polymeric adsorbents for possible use in an extracorporeal hemodialysis device. The adsorbents considered span a range of pore sizes and include both strongly hydrophobic divinylbenzene (DVB) matrices as well as a less hydrophobic acrylate matrix. Adsorption equilibrium and rate measurements were made for these matrices using human serum albumin (HSA), polyclonal human immunoglobulin G (IgG), and bilirubin (BR), as representative plasma components. Pore size was found to contribute significantly to selectivity. Results demonstrated that strongly hydrophobic materials with pore sizes that allow free access to protein-bound BR are most effective for BR removal whether they are initially clean or pre-saturated with HSA.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsPlasma proteinsProtein adsorptionBilirubinHemodialysisLiver FailureRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For both resins, elution with a salt gradient results in multiple peaks for each of the three BiSAb molecules at short residence times. The peaks gradually merge into two peaks and then into one peak eluting at intermediate salt concentrations when the residence time is gradually increased. Re-injecting fractions of each the individual peaks obtained at short residence time results in nearly the same multiple peak elution pattern. This behavior, which is contrary to the behavior normally encountered in ion exchange chromatography, appears to be related to the reversible, surface -catalyzed interconversion between different conformational states of each BiSAb that interact with different strength with the chromatographic surface. This behavior is qualitatively independent of pH in the range 5\u20138.5, protein load in the range 0.06\u20135.0\u2009mg/ml, and gradient slope, and is not associated with the formation of aggregates. Gradually increasing temperature, however, reduces the multiple peak behavior eventually resulting into a single peak at 55\u2009\u00b0C A phenomenological model is developed that predicts the experimental behavior over a broad range of conditions using fitted rate and equilibrium constants.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsBispecific antibodiesCation exchange chromatographyMultiple peak elutionConformational changesMechanistic modelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In general, an increase in salt concentration drives protein partitioning to the hydrophobic surface while a decrease reduces it. In some cases, however, protein retention also increases at low salt concentrations resulting in a U-shaped retention factor curve. During gradient elution the salt concentration is gradually decreased from a high value thereby reducing the retention factor and increasing the protein chromatographic velocity. For these conditions, a steep gradient can overtake the protein in the column, causing it to rebind. Two dynamic models, one based on the local equilibrium theory and the other based on the linear driving force approximation, are presented. We show that the normalized gradient slope determines whether the protein elutes in the gradient, partially elutes, or is trapped in the column. Experimental results are presented for two different monoclonal antibodies and for lysozyme on Capto Phenyl (High Sub) resin. One of the mAbs and lysozyme exhibit U-shaped retention factor curves and for each, we determine the critical gradient slope beyond which 100% recovery is no longer possible. Elution with a reverse gradient is also demonstrated at low salt concentrations for these proteins. Understanding this behavior has implications in the design of gradient elution since the gradient slope impacts protein recovery.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsHydrophobic interaction chromatographyGradient elutionProteinsAntibodiesU-shaped retention factor curvesRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The continuous annular Chromatograph consists of a slowly rotating annular bed of ion exchange resin to which feed is continuously introduced at a stationary point at the top of the bed while eluent flows over the remainder of the annulus. The rotation of the sorbent bed coupled with the simultaneous elution chromatography causes the separated components of the feed stream to appear as helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point.The separation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, using the calcium form of cationic ion exchange resin, uses water as the isocratic eluent. A synthetic mixture of the sugar was explored in fixed columns, then on a bench scale unit. The results almost perfectly scaled to the pilot unit when loading was low and feed mixtures were of low viscosity. Factors such as column loading, feed-to-eluent ratio, and feed concentration were explored. An industrial sugar mixture containing the three sugars and a number of higher molecular sugars was successfully separated. Based on these results, recommendations are made concerning an optimized scaling of the process.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution.\n\n\n\n\nAccess options\n\nBuy single article\n\n\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\n\n\nUSD 39.95\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRent this article via DeepDyve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about Institutional subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviationsa:\nParticle-fluid interfacial area, cm2\n\nc:\nLiquid-phase solute concentration, g/cm3\n\ncF\n                           :\nFeed solute concentration, g/cm3\n\nc*:\nEquilibrium concentration, g/cm3\n\n\nD\nz\n                  :\nAxial dispersion coefficient, g/cm2/s\n\n\nD\u00f8\n                  :\nAngular dispersion coefficient, g/cm2\n\n\nk\no\n                  :\nGlobal mass transfer coefficient, cm/s\n\nK\n                  :\nEquilibrium distribution coefficient\n\nq\n                  :\nSorbent solute concentration, gsolute/gsolid\n\n\nQ\n                  :\nColumn loading of solute, gsolute/gsolid\n\n\nQf\n                  :\nFeed flowrate, g/s\n\nQt\n                  :\nTotal flowrate, g/s\n\nR\no\n                  :\nOutside radius of annular bed, cm\n\nt\n                  :\nTime, s\n\n\\(\\hat t\\)\n                  :\nChromatographie time, s\n\nu\n                  :\nSuperficial velocity, cm/s\n\nz\n                  :\nBed axial position, cm\n\n\u2208\n                  :\nBed void fraction\n\n\u03b8\n                  :\nDisplacement from feed point, radians\n\n\u03b8e\n                  :\nElution angle, radians\n\n\u03b8f\n                  :\nFeed angle, radians\n\n\u03c9\n                  :\nRotation rate, radians/s\nReferencesBegovich, J.

A phenomenological model was developed assuming that the BiSAb molecules exist in multiple configurations that interact differently with the resin surface and interconvert at finite rates. In Part II of this work we provide relevant biomolecular perspectives that shed light on the underlying mechanisms. Firstly, we show that crosslinking the BiSAb molecules with a bifunctional reagent, which limits conformational flexibility, suppresses multiple peak elution. Secondly, we show that of the fragments obtained by enzymatic digestion of the BiSAb molecules only those that exhibit a pair of scFv domains show three-peak elution, while only two peaks are observed if a single scFv is present. Thirdly, we analyze the roles of electrostatic and hydrophobic surface properties of the BiSAb domains, identifying regions that are likely responsible for inter-domain and protein-surface interactions. The results demonstrate that the complex elution behavior catalyzed by the combination of surface charge and hydrophobicity of the stationary phase is associated with outstretched and collapsed configurations of the scFv domains relative to the framework IgG.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsBispecific antibodiesCation exchange chromatographyMultiple peak elutionConformational changesHomology modelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The model describes mass transfer as a pseudo-steady state diffusion process through a flat film of thickness equal to one fifth of the particle radius. Starting with an irreversible thermodynamics description of multicomponent diffusion, the flux relationships are integrated across the film yielding analytical expressions for the rate of mass transfer in a multicomponent adsorption system, when adsorption equilibria are described by the extended Langmuir isotherm. The new approximate rate equation can be conveniently used in the numerical simulation of adsorption systems with concentration-dependent micropore or surface diffusivity, and describes the effects of diffusional flux coupling. Results of accuracy comparable with that obtained when using the classical linear-driving-force approximation for systems with constant diffusivities are obtained with this new rate equation for both batch and fixed-bed adsorption calculations. A generalization of the approach based on the Gibbs adsorption isotherm describes mass transfer rates in terms of the spreading-pressure gradient and provides an extension to other multicomponent isotherm forms.\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Gordon Library, WPI\n\nDownload to read the full article text\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferencesCarta, G. and A.

The technique uses an imposed sinusoidal temperature cycle to elicit an adsorbate concentration response in a stirred vessel. Mass transfer parameters (intraparticle diffusivities and film coefficient) are obtained from the steady periodic concentration response by matching experimental phase angle lag and amplitude ratio to model predictions. The technique is applied to the adsorption of the amino acids phenylalanine and tryptophan from aqueous solution onto two commercial polymeric adsorbents with varying pore size. In all cases, the technique yields results that are consistent with the behavior observed in isothermal batch uptake experiments with a finite concentration step. However, the frequency response technique is found to provide the advantage of yielding mass transfer parameters for near equilibrium conditions and of detecting deviations from Fickian diffusion behavior, such as the presence of surface barriers.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsFrequency responseliquid-phase adsorptionpolymeric adsorbentsamino acidsdiffusionmass transferRecommended articlesCited by (0)Copyright \u00a9 1997 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

We investigated the adsorption characteristics of mixtures comprised of a larger protein (secretory immunoglobulins or thyroglobulin) and a smaller protein (serum albumin or green fluorescence protein) on the small-pore anion exchanger Q Sepharose FF. Confocal laser scanning microscopy measurements revealed that binding of the large protein was extremely slow and eventually stopped completely after the adsorption front penetrated just a few \u03bcm into the particle. Binding capacities after 24\u2009h of incubation were nevertheless around 35\u2009mg/mL of particle which is relatively high when considering that only a fraction of the particle was saturated, suggesting that locally-high bound protein concentrations are attained in a layer close to the particle surface. During mixture adsorption, the bound protein layer also significantly hindered diffusion of the smaller proteins into the particles resulting in about three times slower adsorption kinetics compared to single component adsorption. The combined effects of restricted diffusion and protein binding explain why flow-through purification of these mixtures with the small-pore resin Q Sepharose FF is effective under practical conditions. In this resin, diffusion of secretory immunoglobulins (or thyroglobulin) is restricted in the small pores so that despite their intrinsically greater affinity for the resin, much less binds compared to small proteins. Using the large-pore resin POROS 50 HQ results in faster transport, but also in more binding of secretory immunoglobulins (or thyroglobulin) compared to smaller protein impurities, preventing effective flow-through purification.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsHindered diffusionFlow-through purificationConfocal laser scanning microscopySecretory immunoglobulinsRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current address: Novartis Technical Operations Biotechnology, Sandoz GmbH, Biochemiestrasse 10, 6336 Langkampfen, Austria.View Abstract\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The lysine breakthrough curves have a complex behavior that depends on the pH of the feed solution. At high pH, when lysine is predominately monovalent, an equilibrium binding capacity approaching the total resin ion exchange capacity is obtained but the breakthrough curve is gradual. Conversely, at low feed pH, when lysine is predominately divalent, a sharper breakthrough curve is obtained but the equilibrium binding capacity is only about one half of the total resin ion exchange capacity. Finally, at intermediate feed pH, when divalent and monovalent lysine forms coexist in the feed solution, a breakthrough curve comprising an initial gradual wave followed by a plateau and then by a sharper front is obtained. A local equilibrium model is developed to describe the wave shapes. The model is in agreement with the experimentally observed wave shapes although it only affords a qualitative prediction of the effluent concentration profiles. A rate model, taking into account the coupled diffusion of lysine cations, ammonium ion, potassium ion, and hydrogen ion in the resin as well as the reversible interconversion of divalent and monovalent lysine, is thus developed for a quantitative prediction. The rate model is in excellent agreement with experimental effluent concentration profiles and provides a means to rationally design and optimize lysine ion exchange processes. Keywords: Column adsorptionColumn desorptionLysineBreakthrough curvesEquilibrium modelRate modelIon exchange processes\n\n\n\n\n Introduction In Part I of this work,[1] we examined the equilibrium and kinetics of lysine ion exchange on a strong acid, styrene\u2010divinylbenzene cation exchanger. Adsorption of lysine was shown to occur via the stoichiometric exchange of divalent lysine cations, monovalent lysine cations, or a combination of both, depending on the composition of the solution. The lysine adsorption isotherm, thus, has a complex shape. Constant co\u2010ion concentration isotherms are favorable at low pH but become S\u2010shaped when the lysine concentration is increased. The mass transfer kinetics, which control the rate of ion exchange, are also complicated by the reversible interconversion of divalent and monovalent lysine species in solution and within the resin phase. Moreover, divalent and monovalent lysine diffuse at very different rates and their fluxes are coupled electrostatically to those of other inorganic counterions. Industrial application of ion exchange for the recovery and separation of amino acids is ordinarily carried out in fixed beds using either single column[2] or multicolumn simulated moving bed systems.[3] Using a cation exchanger, amino acids, such as lysine, can be loaded at a low pH, where they are favorably adsorbed, and desorbed with an alkaline solution that raises the pH to a value where the amino acid becomes negatively charged. For these conditions, desorption is completely mass transfer controlled, since the negatively charged form is largely excluded from the resin by the Donnan potential effect. In order to design these processes rationally it is desirable to understand column dynamics and develop accurate models to the effluent profiles as a function of flow rate and feed composition. Both ion exchange equilibria and mass transfer[4] [5] affect column dynamics. Ion exchange equilibrium determines the wave characteristics and is especially critical in the adsorption step. Mass transfer, on the other hand, determines band broadening and is especially important at high flow rates, when the residence time is too short to attain local equilibrium, and in the desorption step, when equilibrium no longer plays a role. The dynamics of fixed\u2010bed separations of amino acids by ion exchange were examined previously by several authors. Equilibrium stage models were used to simulate displacement chromatography separation of mixtures of neutral and acidic amino acids on cation exchange resins.[6] [7] In this approach, the bed is modeled as a series of equilibrium stages and physical dispersion effects are simulated by the associated numerical dispersion. Kawakita et al.[2] used this approach to model lysine ion exchange in cation exchange columns. While computationally straightforward, these models cannot predict mass transfer effects quantitatively and are inadequate for the desorption step, which is typically completely mass transfer controlled. Local equilibrium models have also been used to describe the displacement separation of amino acid mixtures. An advantage of these models is that the limiting solution attainable in the absence of physical dispersion effects can be obtained directly. Carta and Dinerman,[9] used a local equilibrium model to determine the effects of selectivity reversal on the displacement separation of isoleucine and \u03b1\u2010aminobutyric acid. Finally, models taking mass transfer into account explicitly also have been developed for neutral amino acids in cation exchange columns. Saunders et al.[7] and Carta et al.,[10] for example, used detailed intraparticle diffusion models to describe the breakthrough and desorption behavior of phenylalanine and tyrosine on a macroreticular strong acid cation exchanger. While accurate, these models tend to require excessive computation times for practical calculations, making simpler approaches desirable. Melis et al.,[11] for example, developed a lumped model to describe mass transfer effects in the cyclic adsorption\u2013desorption of proline based on a simplified form of the Nernst\u2010Planck model cast in terms of a linear driving force approximation. A related approach, which is more rigorous while retaining an equivalent computational simplicity, was developed by Carta and Lewus[12] based on a film model approximation. In this case, the mass transfer resistance is represented by steady diffusion through a solid film of thickness equal to one fifth of the particle size. Analytical integration of the pertinent diffusion equations along the film thickness provides closed\u2010form rate equations that correctly describe the electrostatic coupling effects of the Nernst\u2010Planck model. This paper has two main objectives. The first is to develop a local equilibrium model to describe the adsorptive behavior of lysine in a cation exchange resin bed as a function of solution composition. In particular, we are interested in understanding the influence of the complex isotherm shape on column dynamics. The second objective is to develop a mass transfer model to describe the adsorption\u2010desorption behavior of lysine over a broad range of conditions. While models of this type have been developed for neutral amino acids, the interplay of divalent and monovalent lysine forms poses additional challenges. For this purpose, a model based on the film model approximation of Carta and Lewus[12] is developed in conjunction with equilibrium models and diffusivity data obtained in Part I of this work. In Part III, we will explore the application of this model to simulate the dynamic behavior of multicolumn, simulated moving bed systems for lysine recovery and separation.  Materials and Methods The resin used in this work is Dowex HCR\u2010W2 (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI), a typical gel\u2010type poly(styrene\u2010divinylbenzene) cation exchanger with a nominal divinylbenzene (DVB) content of 8% and sulfonic acid functional groups. The mean particle diameter of the hydrogen form resin is 714\u00a0\u00b5m, the dry\u2010weight is 0.48\u00a0g\u00a0dry/g of hydrated resin, the bead density is 0.65\u00a0g\u00a0dry/cm3 of hydrated particle, and the total ion exchange capacity is 5.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mequiv/g dry H\u2010form resin.[1] L\u2010lysine and other chemicals were obtained as described in Part I of this work. Column experiments were conducted with glass chromatography columns 1.5\u00a0cm in diameter and 10 or 20\u00a0cm in length (Spectrum Chromatography, Houston, TX). The columns were packed by slurrying the resin with an equal volume of water and quickly pouring the slurry in followed by flow packing. The packed bed density of these columns was 0.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0g\u00a0dry\u00a0resin/cm3, determined by emptying a packed column and weighing the oven\u2010dried resin; and the void fraction was 0.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, based on pulse injections of blue dextran (MW\u00a0\u223c\u00a02,000,000) detected at 280\u00a0nm with a Waters ultraviolet (UV) chromatographic detector. Pulse injections of NaNO2 (also detected with the UV detector but at 254\u00a0nm) in either 1\u00a0M ammonium hydroxide or ammonium chloride yielded very similar values of the void fraction between 0.40 and 0.42. Feed solutions containing 0.20\u00a0M lysine with chloride concentrations of 0.20, 0.36, or 0.56\u00a0M as well as lysine solutions containing small amounts of potassium ion were used in breakthrough experiments while 1\u00a0M ammonium hydroxide was used as the desorbent. The feed solutions were prepared from stock solutions of lysine hydrochloride, HCl, and potassium chloride. Syringe\u2010type FPLC pumps (Model P\u2010500, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) were used to supply the feed and desorbent solutions. The effluent pH was monitored with an online pH meter (LKB, Model 2195\u2010100) while the composition was determined by collecting samples with a Gilson Model 201 fraction collector for high\u2010pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis as described in Ref.[1].  Modeling and Experimental Results  Lysine Breakthrough\u2014Local Equilibrium Model In the following section we consider the breakthrough behavior of lysine, initially in ammonium form, in a cation exchange resin column. As shown in Part I of this work, lysine adsorption involves the exchange of divalent lysine, monovalent lysine, or a combination of both, depending on the solution pH. Ion exchange of the divalent form is favorable but the lysine uptake capacity is limited to about one half of the ion exchange capacity. Conversely, ion exchange of the monovalent form is unfavorable, but the lysine uptake capacity can approach the total ion exchange capacity of the resin. Assuming plug flow and neglecting axial dispersion, the following bed conservation equations can be written:    where C  L  and q  L  are the total lysine concentrations in the solution and resin phase, respectively, and C  N  and q  N  are the corresponding total ammonia concentrations. An additional conservation equation can also be written for the co\u2010ion (chloride in our case). However, assuming that co\u2010ion exclusion from the resin is complete, this equation is trivial.  Equations 1 and 2 are coupled with the solution and ion exchange equilibrium relationships developed in Part I of this work.[1] It should be noted that writing the conservation equations in terms of total lysine and total ammonia is sufficient. In fact, given C  L , C  N , and the co\u2010ion concentration, the electroneutrality condition for the solution phase can be solved providing the pH, and, hence, the speciation of charged lysine and ammonia forms in the solution surrounding the resin particles. In turn this can be used to calculate the resin equilibrium composition via the mass action law relationships governing the ion exchange reactions.[1]  The local equilibrium solution is constructed by mapping characteristics on the hodograph plane C  N , C  L , and then determining the concentration profiles along characteristics using the corresponding characteristic velocities.[4] The latter are obtained as follows. For simple waves we have    while for shock waves we have    The partial derivatives and the q\u2010values appearing in these expressions are evaluated numerically from the ion exchange and solution equilibrium relationships developed in Part I[1] while \u2032 and \u2033 denote conditions upstream and downstream of the wave. Coherent paths on the hodograph plane are found by equating the characteristic velocities and determining the slopes dC  N /dC  L .[4] [13] For simple waves we obtain    where the appropriate value of \u03bb is selected by requiring that the characteristic velocity increases move downstream in the column. Similarly, coherent shock paths are found by equating shock velocities, yielding    Starting with known values of upstream concentrations, the downstream concentrations for a coherent shock wave can be found by trial and error from this equation. As for simple waves, only one of the two possible trajectories obtained with this procedure will be physically realistic. Numerical calculations based on these equations are shown later and compared with experimental lysine breakthrough curves obtained with the same feed lysine concentrations but with different chloride concentrations and, hence, different feed pH. The parameters used are summarized in Table 1 and the three cases considered are shown in Figs. 1\u20133. In Case 1 (Fig. 1) the lysine feed pH is 5.57, which, as shown in Part I of this paper, corresponds to a predominance of monovalent lysine. In Case 2 (Fig. 2) the lysine feed pH is 0.80, which corresponds to a predominance of divalent lysine. Finally, in Case 3 (Fig. 3) the lysine feed pH is 1.85, which corresponds to a mixture of monovalent and divalent lysine. The following dimensionless variables are defined: v  c *\u00a0=\u00a0v  c /v, v  s *\u00a0=\u00a0v  s /v, and RV\u00a0=\u00a0\u03f5/v*. The quantity relative volumes (RV) represents the number of column volumes passed. The corresponding hodograph planes are also shown in Figs. 1\u20133. Point A is the feed and point C is the state downstream of the lysine wave. As the chloride ion is not adsorbed, it moves quickly through the column. Hence, the effluent reaches point C with C  L \u00a0=\u00a00 and C\u00a0=\u00a0C  F   Cl \u2212 \u00a0=\u00a00 when RV\u00a0=\u00a0\u03f5. Of course, the initial conditions prevail for RV\u00a0<\u00a0\u03f5. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. II.

The concentration profile is calculated by computing the characteristic velocity at each point along the AC path and is shown in Fig. 1a in comparison with experimental results. The gradual nature of the simple wave is evident as even in the absence of mass transfer resistance a smooth profile is observed. This trend is also clearly seen for the experimental curves with the main difference being that the experimental profiles are somewhat more spread out.   Solution for Case 2 The hodograph plane is shown in Fig. 2b. Point A is the feed and the corresponding equilibrium resin composition is q  L \u00a0=\u00a02.52\u00a0mmol/g and q  N \u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0mmol/g.

The RV\u2010value corresponding to the shock is thus 0.41/0.19\u00a0=\u00a02.13. The following values are obtained from Eqs. 9 and 5: Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. II.

The concentration profile calculated along the BC path is shown in Fig. 2a. Note that state B is represented by an intermediate plateau followed by a shock where the lysine concentration goes from zero to the feed value. The self\u2010sharpening behavior of the shock is due to the favorable nature of the divalent lysine\u2013ammonium ion exchange. Conversely, the simple wave BC results from the unfavorable exchange of hydrogen ions for ammonium ion. Figure 2a shows the corresponding effluent concentration profiles, which comprise an initial plateau of ammonium ion (C) followed by a simple wave. An intermediate plateau (B) is followed by a shock where the lysine concentration goes from zero to the feed value (A). The agreement with the experimental results is substantial. The main difference is that the concentration profiles between states B and A are more gradual as a result of the slow diffusion of divalent lysine in the resin beads.   Solution for Case 3 In this case monovalent and divalent lysine coexist in the feed. The hodograph plane is shown in Fig. 3b. Point A is the feed and the corresponding resin composition is q  L \u00a0=\u00a02.68\u00a0mmol/g and q  N \u00a0=\u00a00. Point C represents the condition C  L \u00a0=\u00a00, C  N \u00a0=\u00a0C  F   Cl \u2212 . The following values are calculated from Eqs. 9 and 5: Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. II.

The shock path is shown by line AB, which intersects the simple wave path starting from point C at point B. Thus, the solution consists of a shock between states A and B, followed by a plateau and a simple wave between states B and C. Point B is found by trial and error from Eq. 10 by setting:    We obtain C  N \u00a0=\u00a00.26\u00a0M, C  L \u00a0=\u00a00.092\u00a0M, q  N \u00a0=\u00a04.43\u00a0mmol/g, q  L \u00a0=\u00a00.83\u00a0mmol/g, v*(B)\u00a0=\u00a00.24, and v  s * (A,B)\u00a0=\u00a00.14. The corresponding RV value is 0.41/0.144\u00a0=\u00a02.84. Obviously, the AB shock is due to the favorable nature of the exchange of divalent lysine for ammonium ion, while the simple wave BC is due to the unfavorable nature of the exchange of monovalent lysine and ammonium ion. Figure 3a shows the calculated effluent concentration profiles. A bipartite behavior can be seen. Initially, following an initial plateau corresponding to state C, there is a single, gradual wave to state B. Then, following an intermediate plateau there is a shock wave of divalent lysine to state A. Again, the local equilibrium model correctly predicts the general shape of the breakthrough curve. Mass transfer effects that are addressed in the next section cause the difference between theory and experimental results. Interestingly, an analogous equilibrium dynamics behavior also has been seen for the anion exchange behavior of chromate ion.[14] In that case, the uptake isotherm is S\u2010shaped. Thus, early breakthrough occurs followed by a shock when the feed concentration is greater than the inflection point of the isotherm.    Lysine Breakthrough and Desorption\u2014Mass Transfer Model We now consider the general case of a system containing lysine, ammonia, potassium ion, and hydrogen ion. Assuming plug flow and neglecting axial dispersion, the conservation equations are the same as Eqs. 1\u20134 with the following additional equation and boundary conditions for potassium ion:    These equations are now coupled with the following rate equations.    where J  Lys ++  and J  Lys +  are the divalent and monovalent lysine fluxes, J  NH 4 +  and J  NH 3  are the ammonium ion and free ammonia fluxes, and J  K +  is the potassium ion flux. The following relationships exist between total lysine and total ammonia and the counterion concentrations:    where q 0 is the total resin ion exchange capacity. Additionally, we have the following two relationships expressing the dissociation equilibrium of divalent lysine and ammonium ion in the resin phase:    The first of these two relationships was determined in Part I of this work while the second is discussed later. Combining Eqs. 17\u201321, we obtain:    In turn, the derivatives \u2202q  L /\u2202t and \u2202q  N /\u2202t can be expressed as:    where    Finally, it is necessary to express the mass transfer fluxes. In Part I of this work,[1] we showed that mass transfer in batch adsorption could be described using the Nernst\u2010Planck model. The corresponding partial differential equation formulation is however computationally cumbersome for column calculations. Thus, as an alternative we use the film model approximation of Carta and Lewus[12] where the mass transfer resistance is represented by steady diffusion through a flat solid film of thickness equal to one fifth of the particle radius. Accordingly, the right hand sides of Eqs. 14\u201316 are given by:[12]    where m is obtained by solving the equation:    The starred quantities appearing in these equations are the interfacial equilibrium resin composition. As shown in Ref.[12] the film model approximation describes the electrostatic coupling of diffusion fluxes while retaining the simplicity and relative accuracy of the classical linear driving force approximation (LDF) for uncoupled diffusion. The equations were solved numerically by discretizing the axial derivatives by backwards finite difference and using subroutine DIVPAG in the IMSL Mathematical and Statistical Libraries (Visual Numerics, Inc., San Ramon, CA) to solve the resulting set of ordinary differential equations as discussed in Ref.[1].   Rate Model Parameters and Results The equilibrium and rate parameters appearing in the rate model were previously determined in Part I of this work[1] with the exception of the dissociation constant for ammonium ion, K\u2032 N , and the NH3 diffusivity in the resin phase, which were determined as follows. A packed column was first equilibrated with an ammonia solution and then eluted with distilled, de\u2010ionized water. The results of three such experiments with different initial ammonia concentrations are shown in Fig. 4. At these concentrations, ammonia is primarily in NH3 form since pK  N \u00a0\u223c\u00a09.25.[15] Upon elution with water, the resin remains in the ammonium ion form since the hydrogen ion concentration in water is extremely low. However, any NH3 initially present in the resin phase is eluted. The elution volume obtained by integrating the elution curves in Fig. 4 is RV\u00a0=\u00a00.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01. In turn, this is related to the distribution coefficient of NH3 in the resin by the relationship    Thus, since \u03f5\u00a0=\u00a00.41 for this column, K  NH 3 \u00a0=\u00a00.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01. For the resin phase we thus have:     Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. II.

The line is calculated from a mass transfer model as discussed in the text.  Two additional relationships can be written. The first is for the dissociation of ammonium ion in solution:    while the second, determined in Part I of this work,[1] is for the ion exchange equilibrium of the ammonium and hydrogen ions:    Combining the latter three equations yields the final result:    or pK\u2032 N \u00a0\u223c\u00a09.6. This value is somewhat greater than the value in free solution, which can be expected as a result of the high ionic strength in the resin phase (see Ref. 16) and the presence of the charged polymer matrix. Finally, since the resin density is 0.65\u00a0g\u00a0dry/cm3, K\u2032 N \u00a0=\u00a04.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0mmol/g dry using a dry weight basis. The last parameter to be determined is the diffusivity of NH3 in the resin. A value of D  NH 3 \u00a0=\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0cn2/s was obtained by fitting the general linear isotherm analytical solution of Carta[17] to the ammonia elution curves as shown in Fig. 4. As expected, this value is lower than in free solution but similar to the diffusivity of ammonium ion. A complete summary of the model parameters is given in Table 1. Comparisons of experimental breakthrough and desorption curves with model predictions are shown in Figs. 5\u20137 for lysine feeds at high, low, and intermediate pH. In each case, desorption was with 1\u00a0M ammonia. The agreement between experimental and predicted lysine and ammonia concentration profiles is generally very good. The rate model correctly predicts the wave shapes as a function of pH as well as the tailing behavior in the lysine desorption curve. The latter is caused entirely by the slow diffusion of lysine in the resin. Some significant deviations are seen in some cases between experimental and predicted pH profiles. Two factors contribute to those differences. The first is that near neutral pH, the pH scale exaggerates differences in hydrogen ion concentration. For example a difference between pH 4 and pH 5 translates to a hydrogen ion concentration difference around 10\u22124\u00a0M. This is much smaller than all other ion concentrations are so that it cannot be predicted exactly. Another reason is that the solution phase is treated as ideal in the model; i.e., activity coefficients were assumed to be unity. The pH meter, however, measures the activity of hydrogen ion, which is likely to have an effect especially at very high concentrations. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. II.

In particular, tailing of the desorption curve occurs to a greater extent in excellent agreement with model predictions. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. II.

Lines are calculated from the mass transfer model.  The effect of potassium ion present in the lysine feed as an impurity is shown in Figs. 10 and 11. For the high pH feed (Fig. 10), breakthrough of potassium ion occurs after breakthrough of lysine as potassium is more favorably bound by the resin. Thus, upon desorption with ammonia, a significant potassium peak contaminates the lysine recovered (Fig. 10b). Conversely, for the low pH feed, potassium ion breaks through ahead of the lysine front and negligible contamination of the lysine desorption peak is seen in Fig. 11b. This occurs as a result of the favorable exchange of divalent lysine. The model predictions are once again in good agreement with the experimental results. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin.

Lines are calculated from the mass transfer model.  A final consideration is the ability of the rate model to predict the reversible interconversion of monovalent and divalent lysine in the column. To test this effect, a column was initially equilibrated with a divalent lysine solution with C  L \u00a0=\u00a00.20\u00a0M and C  Cl \u2212 \u00a0=\u00a00.56\u00a0M and then supplied with a monovalent lysine feed with C  L \u00a0=\u00a00.20\u00a0M and C  Cl \u2212 \u00a0=\u00a00.20\u00a0M. The results are shown in Fig. 12. It can be seen that as the chloride ion concentration is changed from 0.56 to 0.20\u00a0M, the effluent lysine concentration temporarily decreases. This occurs because divalent lysine in the resin is converted to the monovalent form allowing the uptake of additional lysine. After achieving equilibrium, the feed was switched again to the divalent lysine solution with C  L \u00a0=\u00a00.20\u00a0M and C  Cl \u2212 \u00a0=\u00a00.56\u00a0M. In this case, as seen in Fig. 12, the effluent lysine concentration shows a fairly sharp peak approaching 0.5\u00a0M. This occurs as monovalent lysine in the resin is converted to the divalent form causing lysine to be desorbed from the resin in order to accommodate the increased charge. As seen in Fig. 12, the rate model predictions are in excellent agreement with the observed concentration profiles. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. II.

Lines are calculated from the mass transfer model.    Conclusions Two modeling approaches were adopted to describe the column adsorption and desorption behavior of lysine cation exchange. The first approach, based on the assumption of local equilibrium, predicts the effects of lysine feed pH on the breakthrough curve. A gradual wave is obtained when the feed contains predominately monovalent lysine, while a shock is obtained when the divalent form is dominant. At intermediate lysine feed pH, a complex breakthrough curve comprising a gradual wave followed by a shock is obtained. The second modeling approach is based on a rate model incorporating equilibrium and diffusion parameters determined in Part I of this work. The model employs a film model approximation to describe interphase mass transfer and is found to provide a quantitative prediction of the lysine breakthrough curves. The model also predicts the lysine desorption behavior, the effects of potassium present as an impurity in the lysine feed, and the reversible interconversion of monovalent and divalent lysine in the column. As seen experimentally as well as through the model predictions in Figs. 5 and 6, the feed pH has an interesting effect on the lysine dynamic binding capacity. Although the equilibrium uptake capacity at high pH (Fig. 5) is nearly double the capacity observed at low pH (Fig. 6), lysine breakthrough actually occurs earlier in Fig. 5 than it does in Fig. 6. This occurs because while the capacity is greater, the exchange equilibrium is unfavorable for monovalent lysine, which is predominant in Fig. 5. Although diffusion of divalent lysine in the resin is slow, the favorable nature of the ion exchange equilibrium still results in a sharper breakthrough curve. While it is not easy to predict a priori which of these effects is dominant for different conditions, it appears that optimum conditions can be chosen following the modeling approaches developed in this work.

Using equilibrium data available from the literature, the model demonstrates that 15\u221235 wt% nitric acid may be efficiently used to reduce pollutant emissions in NOx-containing gases having low degree of oxidation. Lower oxides of nitrogen accumulate in the liquid as nitrous acid which is carried away by the nitric acid solution. The scrubbed gas contains a reduced concentration of nitrogen oxides and has a higher degree of oxidation than the feed gas.

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) monomer, BSA dimer, and thyroglobulin (Tg) were used as model proteins. Based on TEM imaging and iSEC, the Nuvia resins have a microgranular structure and large pores (110 nm radius), while the Capto resins have a fibrous structure and smaller pores (32-36 nm radius). Comparable binding capacities (80-110 mg/mL), decreasing as salt is added, are observed for all three proteins on the Nuvia resins. Higher capacities (110-130 mg/mL), also decreasing as salt is added, are observed for BSA monomer and dimer on the Capto resins. However, the Tg binding capacity is very low in this case and increases as salt is added. Confocal laser scanning microscopy show that the kinetics are controlled by pore diffusion for all four resins, but with diffusivities that decrease as the protein size increases especially for the Capto resins. For Tg at low salt, binding is restricted to a thin shell close to the bead surface for both Capto resins. The ratio of effective and free diffusivity is about 0.30, 0.18, and 0.08 for BSA monomer, BSA dimer, and Tg, respectively, on the Nuvia resin. These values decrease to about 0.11, 0.04, and 0.01, respectively, for the Capto resins as a result of diffusional hindrance. Dynamic binding capacities are consistent with the equilibrium and rate behaviors.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKEYWORDSMultimodal anion exchangersStructureAdsorption equilibriumAdsorption kineticsDynamic binding capacityModelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Two commercial C18 silica packings are used, one irregular and one spherical and monodispersed. For each packing, the relationship between mobile phase flow-rate, column backpressure, and radial compression pressure is determined. A model is proposed to explain this relationship and determine the radial compression pressure needed to maintain the column effectively compressed at each operating flow-rate. The chromatographic efficiency of these columns is also determined. When an adequate radial compression level is used, the efficiency of the preparative-scale system is nearly the same as that of analytical-scale columns. Applying incremental levels of radial compression can also lead to a restoration of the efficiency of columns whose performance was degraded by operation at low radial compression pressures.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current address: Pfizer Inc., Groton, CT, USA.View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 1995 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Both resins are agarose-based and contain an adsorbing core surrounded by an inert shell. Although shell thicknesses are comparable (3.6 and 4.2\u00a0\u00b5m for Capto Core 400 and 700, respectively), the two resins differ substantially in pore size (pore radii of 19 and 50\u00a0nm, respectively). Because of the smaller pores and higher surface area, the BSA binding capacity of Capto Core 400 is approximately double that of Capto Core 700. However, for the much larger Tg, the attainable capacity is substantially larger for Capto Core 700. Mass transfer in both resins is affected by diffusional resistances through the shell and within the adsorbing core. For BSA, core and shell effective pore diffusivities are about 0.25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 and 0.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0cm2/s, respectively, for Capto Core 400, and about 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 and 2.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0cm2/s, respectively, for Capto Core 700. These values decrease dramatically for Tg to 0.022\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 and 0.088\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0cm2/s and to 0.13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 and 0.59\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0cm2/s for Capto Core 400 and 700, respectively. Adsorbed Tg further hinders diffusion of BSA in both resins. Column measurements show that, despite the higher static capacity of Capto Core 400 for BSA, the dynamic binding capacity is greater for Capto Core 700 as a result of its faster kinetics. However, some of this advantage is lost if the feed is a mixture of BSA and Tg since, in this case, Tg binding leads to greater diffusional hindrance for BSA.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsCore-shell resinsFlow-through purificationDiffusional hindranceDynamic binding capacityModelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aims to characterize the structure and functional properties of this resin using bovine serum albumin (BSA, Mr~65\u00a0kDa) and thyroglobulin (Tg, Mr~660\u00a0kDa) as model impurity proteins. The functionalized adsorbing core and the inert shell have the same fibrous structure typical of agarose-based beads. The resin average bead size is 90.7\u00a0\u03bcm with a range of 50\u2013130\u00a0\u03bcm, the shell thickness is 4.18\u00a0\u00b5m with a range of 3\u20136\u00a0\u00b5m and a standard deviation of 0.55\u00a0\u00b5m, and the pore radius, obtained by inverse size exclusion chromatography, is 50.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0nm. Both proteins present highly favorable binding isotherms with maximum binding capacities of 55 and 105\u00a0mg/mL of total bead volume for BSA and Tg, respectively. The addition of 500\u00a0mM NaCl reduces the binding capacity by less than 50%, showing the ability of the resin to operate at high salt conditions. For both proteins, the effective pore diffusivity in the core is smaller than in the shell due to additional hindrance by bound protein in the core area. Effective pore diffusivities values in the core are 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 and 0.16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 cm2/s for BSA and Tg, respectively. The DBC10% at 2\u00a0min residence time are 24 and 2\u00a0mg/mL for BSA and Tg, respectively. This study provides qualitative and quantitative information about Capto\u2122 Core 700 resin. This information could be used to predict and optimize the purification of large biomolecules and bioparticle in route to the establishment of more effective downstream processes.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsCore-shell particlesFlow-through purificationMass transferModelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The system simulated comprises an adsorption zone, a desorption zone, and two zones where unadsorbed feed components and excess desorbent are removed. Multiple columns are distributed among the four zones in different simulated countercurrent schemes, including a scheme that allows recycling of excess desorbent and another where the lysine recovery yield is enhanced at low flow rates by lowering the pH in the last column of the adsorption zone. Model predictions are validated by comparison with experimental results obtained in an eight\u2010column bench scale apparatus and a parametric study is conducted with the model to determine the effects of critical design variables.  Keywords: Equilibriakineticscolumn dynamicslysine adsorptionion exchange\n\n\n\n\n Introduction In our prior work 1 2, we examined the equilibrium and kinetics of lysine ion exchange on a strong acid, styrene\u2010divinylbenzene cation exchanger and the column dynamic behavior. Lysine possesses a basic side chain. As a result lysine adsorption occurs via the stoichiometric exchange of divalent lysine cations, monovalent lysine cations, or a combination of both, depending on the composition of the solution. The lysine adsorption isotherm, thus, has a complex shape that results in complicated column dynamics. At low\u2010feed pH, when the divalent form is dominant, the lysine breakthrough curve behaves like a shock, since ion exchange of divalent lysine is favorable. Conversely, at high\u2010feed pH, when the monovalent form of lysine is dominant, the breakthrough curve is gradual and exhibits simple wave behavior due to the unfavorable nature of monovalent lysine cation exchange. Finally, at intermediate feed pH values, the breakthrough curve exhibits a gradual portion followed by a shock. The mass transfer kinetics, which control the rate of ion exchange, were also studied; and a model based on the Nernst\u2010Planck formulation was used to describe batch adsorption and desorption. A film model approximation of the Nernst\u2010Planck model was developed to quantitatively predict the lysine breakthrough behavior as well as lysine desorption with ammonium hydroxide. The latter case is completely mass transfer controlled, since the negatively charged form of lysine, dominant at pH greater than 11, is excluded from the cation exchange resin. Thus, equilibrium is no longer limiting and complete desorption is attainable. On the other hand, the rate of desorption is diffusion controlled and is generally slow because of the small diffusivity of lysine cations in the resin. As a result, the desorption curve has a pronounced tail, which has a significant impact on productivity and desorbent consumption. Industrial application of ion exchange for the recovery and separation of amino acids is often carried out in multicolumn systems 3 4. Using a cation exchanger, amino acids, such as lysine, can be loaded at a low pH, where they are favorably adsorbed, and desorbed with an alkaline solution that raises the pH to a value where the amino acid becomes negatively charged. In a multicolumn system, the breakthrough capacity can be increased by staging the columns in a simulated moving bed arrangement. Moreover, the desorbent consumption can be reduced since the high pH effluent from a desorption column can be fed to another column in series providing further contact with lysine loaded resin. Simulated moving bed systems have been used extensively for various applications including the separation of xylenes 5, the separation of glucose\u2010fructose mixtures 6, the separation of phenylalanine/tyrosine mixtures 7, and numerous chiral separations e.g., 8\u201310. These separations are based on relatively small differences in adsorption affinity and are usually operated close to local equilibrium conditions. Methodologies for the design of these systems have also been developed e.g., 11\u201314. In most cases, the starting point is a local equilibrium analysis, which is then extended to account for mass transfer effects. Multicolumn systems for lysine recovery, on the other hand, are different in scope from the more common applications of simulated moving bed systems. The primary objective is to recover lysine from largely nonadsorbed fermentation broth components by adsorbing cationic lysine on a cation exchange resin, followed by elution with base. The product is the free base\u2010form of lysine, which can then be subjected to further purification and eventually crystallization. The process efficiency is a strong function of the uptake capacity and the rate of adsorption and desorption as well as the configuration of the process. Thus, a model taking onto account these factors is desirable for process design and optimization. Several different multicolumn process schemes could be used. The ones considered in this work are shown in Fig. 1. The process schemes shown comprise eight columns, although any number could be used distributed among the different zones. As shown, the columns are arranged in four separate zones supplied with the lysine feed (F), the desorbent (D), and two rinse streams (R1 and R2). The columns are rotated in progression from right to left at periodic time intervals. With reference to Fig. 1A, the process functions as follows. The columns in positions 1 to 3 are supplied with the lysine feed and are connected in series. This series arrangement allows a more efficient containment of the mass transfer zone. If a single column were used for loading, regeneration would have to occur before the adsorption capacity is utilized to a large extent. Conversely, by using two or more columns in series, only the first column is regenerated at each step, allowing a more efficient utilization of the ion exchange capacity. The columns in positions 5\u20137 are supplied with the ammonium hydroxide desorbent. These columns are also connected in a series. Since a long desorption tail is expected as a result of the slow diffusion of lysine in the resin 2, a better utilization of the desorbent stream can be obtained by allowing the alkaline effluent from each column to flow into the next one. Since the amount of lysine desorbed at high pH is largely dependent only on the time of exposure to the ammonium hydroxide solution, a greater amount of lysine can be desorbed in this manner. Finally, there is one column in position 4 and one in position 8. The column in position 4 is purged of the excess ammonium hydroxide remaining in the column interstices prior to moving it to the feed loading train (positions 1\u20133), while the column in position 8 is purged of the unbound fermentation broth contaminants prior to moving it to the lysine recovery train (positions 5\u20137).

Configurations for the multicolumn lysine recovery process. The gray arrows show the direction of column rotation. Display full size Figure 1. Configurations for the multicolumn lysine recovery process. The gray arrows show the direction of column rotation.   Figures 1B and 1C show two alternative configurations. In the first of these, the effluent leaving the R1 rinse column is combined with the desorbent stream to reduce the consumption of ammonia by recycling the ammonia left in the column interstices after desorption. In the second scheme (Fig. 1C), the effluent from the column in position 2 is acidified to convert lysine to its divalent cationic form. This way, the first two columns in the adsorption train can be loaded with monovalent lysine, which results in high capacity, but a broad mass transfer zone, while the last column serves as a final capture step where divalent lysine is loaded with a sharper mass transfer zone, but lower capacity. Obviously, a large number of parameters need to be considered to arrive at an optimum design. As a result, in this work we consider the application of a mass transfer model to describe these operations. The model based on equilibrium and rate determinations made in our prior work 1 2, is validated for multicolumn operation by comparison with experimental results obtained with a bench scale apparatus. The effects of various operating parameters are then determined by numerical simulation.  Materials and Methods The resin used in this work is Dowex HCR\u2010W2 (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI), a typical gel\u2010type poly(styrene\u2010divinylbenzene) cation exchanger with a nominal divinylbenzene (DVB) content of 8% and sulfonic acid functional groups. The mean particle diameter of the hydrogen form resin is 714\u00a0\u00b5m, the dry weight is 0.48\u00a0g dry/g of hydrated resin, the bead density is 0.65\u00a0g dry/cm3 of hydrated particle, and the total ion exchange capacity is 5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u00a0mequiv/g dry H\u2010form resin 1. L\u2010lysine and other chemicals were obtained as described in Part I of this work. Feed solutions were prepared as described in Part I 1 from stock solutions of lysine hydrochloride and potassium chloride. The experimental multicolumn system used in this study consists of five multiposition rotary valves, five high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) pumps, and eight columns. The arrangement used has the advantage of not requiring check valves. Instead, the five multiposition valves obtained from Valco Instruments Co., Inc. (Houston, TX, Model ECSTF8MWEHC) provide the distribution of lysine feed, rinse water, ammonia desorbent, and acid addition streams. The valves have eight pairs of matched ports plus one output and one input part, each connectable to any one of the eight matched port pairs. The matched ports that are not connected to input and output lines are connected to each other. The valves and columns were arranged as shown schematically in Fig. 2.

For clarity the five rotary valves are shown in a linearized form. Operation according to scheme C is shown with column 1 in the R2 zone, columns 2, 3, and 4 in the adsorption zone, column 5 in the R1 zone, and columns 6, 7, and 8 in the desorption zone. The effluent from column 3 is acidified before feeding it to column 4.  The columns were 1.5\u00a0cm I.D., 10\u00a0cm long (Spectrum Chromatography, Houston TX; Model No. 123952) glass chromatography columns. They were packed with identical amounts of resin and connected to the valve system with 0.020\u2033 ID PEEK tubing. Five HPLC pumps from LabAlliance (State College, PA, Series II Pump) were used to supply feed, rinse water streams, desorbent, and acid adsorption streams. The effluent streams were connected to fraction collectors (Gilson, Model 201) for off\u2010line HPLC analysis as described in Nagai and Carta 1. An LKB Model 2195\u2010100 pH/conductivity meter (Bromma, Sweden) was used online to monitor one of the effluent streams and help determine the attainment of steady state. The mV signal from this monitor was collected with a data acquisition system (Keyence, Osaka, Japan, Model NR\u2010250) and logged on a PC. Switching of the valves was performed with electrically operated actuators controlled by a PLC (Keyence, Osaka, Japan, Model KV\u2010700). Most of the dead volume in the system is from the tubing connected columns and valves. This volume was determined to be approximately 0.32\u00a0cm3 per column or approximately 2% of the column volume. Because of the small value, no dead volume correction was deemed necessary.  Model Development The model used to simulate lysine recovery in the multicolumn systems is based on conservation equations for total lysine, total ammonia, potassium ion, and chloride ion and comprises the following components developed in our prior work 1 2.    Solution equilibria. The equilibrium between divalent and monovalent cationic lysine, zwitterionic lysine, and anionic lysine and the equilibrium between ammonium ion and ammonia is expressed in terms of mass action law relationships using known values of the dissociation constants. The concentrations of charged species are bound by the electroneutrality condition, including dissociation of water into hydrogen ion and hydroxyl ion. Since the concentrations of charged lysine species and ammonium ion can be expressed in terms of total lysine, C  L =C  Lys ++ \u2009+\u2009C  Lys + \u2009+\u2009C  Lys \u00b1 \u2009+\u2009C  Lys \u2212 , total ammonia, C  N \u2009=\u2009C  NH 4 + \u2009+\u2009C  NH 3 , and hydrogen ion concentration, the latter can be calculated from the electroneutrality condition if C  L , C  N , C  K + , and C  Cl \u2212  are known. These relationships are given in, Eqs. 9\u201313, in Part I of this work 1.    Ion exchange and sorption equilibria. The ion exchange of divalent and monovalent cationic lysine, ammonium ion, potassium ion, and hydrogen ion is described in terms of mass action law relationships using selectivity coefficients determined experimentally for binary pairs. The relevant equations, Eqs. 1\u20135, are given in Part I of this work 1. We neglect sorption of zwitterionic lysine and anions, an assumption validated experimentally. However, partitioning of NH3 in the resin phase needs to be considered. This is important in the desorption step, since NH3 is the dominant species in the concentrated ammonia solutions used in this work. The partition coefficient for NH3 was obtained in Part II of this work 2. It should be noted that the concentrations of divalent and monovalent lysine and the concentration of ammonium ion and NH3 are related by the corresponding dissociation equilibria. Values of the corresponding dissociation constants for the resin phase were determined in our prior work 1 2.    Mass transfer relationships. Counter diffusion in the resin phase is described by the Nernst\u2010Planck model equations. Counterion diffusivities were determined by matching single component batch uptake experiments with the Nernst\u2010Planck model. This model is, however, computationally too demanding for column calculations, particularly those involving multicolumn systems. Thus, a simpler rate model based on the film model approximation of Carta and Lewus 16 is used to describe mass transfer rates. The relevant equations were obtained in Part II and are given by Eqs. 14\u201316 and 30\u201333 2.    Conservation equations. Conservation equations are written for total lysine, total ammonia, potassium ion, and chloride ions assuming plug flow and neglecting axial dispersion. The relevant equations are given in Part II, Eqs. 1\u20132 and 11 2. The axial derivatives are discretized by finite differences and the resulting system of ordinary differential equations is integrated simultaneously for all columns with the appropriate inlet conditions. The composition of the feed streams and initial resin phase compositions are assigned at the start of the simulation and the equations are integrated while material balances are solved where streams are mixed. At the end of a period the column concentration profiles are reassigned and the process is repeated until a periodic steady state is attained. For this condition, overall material balances for total lysine, total ammonia, potassium ion, and chloride ion are checked to be within \u00b10.1%. The number of switches required to obtain a periodic steady state varied from run to run. Generally, it was larger for smaller switch times and lower flow rates. Starting the simulation with all clean columns required anywhere between 20 and 30 switches.     Experimental Results and Model Predictions The multicolumn apparatus described previously was used to validate the model. Experiments were conducted for the configurations shown in Fig. 1. Scheme A is an open loop configuration without ammonia recycle or acid addition. Scheme B includes a recycle of ammonia while scheme C includes an additional acid stream in the adsorption zone. In each case, the operational specifications include the number of columns in each stream, the switch time, and the column flow rates. A total of 10 experimental runs were performed with the conditions listed in Table 1. In all cases, the feed was a 0.20\u00a0M lysine hydrochloride solution (containing 0.2\u00a0M lysine and 0.2\u00a0M chloride ion). Monovalent lysine is the dominant form of lysine in these solutions 1. The desorbent is 1.0\u00a0M ammonia in water, while the rinse streams are distilled de\u2010ionized water. Runs 1\u20135 are for scheme A, Runs 6\u20137 for scheme B, and Run 8 for scheme C. Runs 9 and 10 are for scheme A and C, respectively, but with the inclusion of potassium chloride in the feed with a 0.05\u00a0M concentration. A 3\u20131\u20133\u20131 scheme with three columns in the adsorption zone, one in the first rinse zone, three in the desorption zone, and one in the second rinse zone was used for all three schemes. Experimentally, the pH of the effluent from the desorption zone was monitored to confirm the achievement of steady state. After reaching steady state, 20 to 40 samples were collected from the effluent from each zone and analyzed by HPLC. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. III.

In these figures the concentration profiles are shown as a function of RV, which is the effluent volume divided by the column volume, for the duration of one switch period. In each case, experimental profiles are compared with model predictions using the parameters summarized Part II of this work 2. Figure 3 shows the effluent profiles for a low flow rate case with scheme A where the switch time chosen was short enough to prevent breakthrough of lysine from the adsorption train but long enough to bring the lysine concentration in the desorption train near zero. Lysine is recovered from the desorption train in free\u2010base form accompanied by a high ammonia concentration. However, it should be noted that the excess ammonia can be recovered readily by evaporation. The maximum lysine concentration in the desorption effluent is around 0.4\u00a0M, while the average is around 0.2\u00a0M, indicating that lysine recovery can be accomplished with essentially 100% yield and without dilution. Figure 4 shows the concentration profiles for the same configuration and switch time but with feed and R2 flow rates increased by a factor of 3 and desorbent and R1 flow rates increased by a factor of 2 relative to Fig. 3. Although the throughput has been increased by a factor of 3, the lysine yield in the desorption train effluent is no longer 100%. This occurs because the switch time is now too long and breakthrough of lysine occurs in the adsorption train. However, as a result of the greater loading of lysine on the resin in the adsorption train, a greater lysine concentration is attained, around 0.7\u00a0M. The tailing visible in Fig. 4 is a result of the slow diffusion of lysine in the resin phase. Figure 5 shows the results for Run 4, which had exactly the same conditions as those in Fig. 4 but a switch time of only 1500\u00a0s. As seen in this figure, the shorter switch time prevents breakthrough of lysine from the adsorption train. The maximum lysine concentration in the desorption effluent is around 0.45\u00a0M, but the average is now 0.3\u00a0M. The only yield loss of lysine occurs in the R2 rinse. This occurs because at the higher flow rate of this run, the first column in the adsorption train is nearly saturated with lysine so that some is lost when the void volume is swept by the R2 stream prior to desorption.

Comparison of experimental and predicted effluent profiles for Run 9 with acid addition scheme C. Conditions are as in Fig. 7 but with lower flow rates and 0.05\u00a0M potassium chloride in the lysine feed stream.   Figure 6 shows effluent concentration profiles for Run 7. The lysine feed flow rate and the switch time are the same as in Run 4 (Fig. 4). However, the system was the ammonia recovery scheme B. As a result, a lower ammonia desorbent flow rate is sufficient to attain essentially complete desorption. There is no breakthrough of lysine from the adsorption train and the yield is close to 100% except for the small lysine loss for RV\u2009<\u20090.4 (the column void fraction) in the R2 column. Comparing Figs. 5 and 6, it can be seen that for short times a relatively high ammonia concentration exists in the effluent of the adsorption train for Run 7 (Fig. 6). This occurs because a much lower rinse flow rate was used in this run so that not all of the excess ammonia from the desorption train was purged in position 4.  Figure 7 shows the profiles for Run 8, which involves acid addition to the third column in the adsorption train (scheme C). As discussed before, divalent lysine is favorably adsorbed and shows a steeper breakthrough curve because the ion exchange equilibrium favors divalent lysine that, in turn, generates a shock wave. Conversely, monovalent lysine results in a shallower breakthrough because of the unfavorable nature of its ion exchange. However, the capacity of the resin for monovalent lysine is twice as large as that for divalent lysine. To prevent lysine leakage from the adsorption train while maintaining high capacity, acid can be added at an intermediate point in the adsorption train to convert monovalent lysine leaking through into divalent lysine as suggested in Van Walsen and Thompson 4. Accordingly, the last column in this train would function as a final capture or polishing bed. Conditions for this run are otherwise identical to those of Run 5 (Fig. 4). The predicted curves show good agreement with experimental data. However, contrary to expectations, the leakage of lysine in the adsorption train is actually larger than in Run 5. This difference is discussed in a later section. Finally, Fig. 8 shows the results for Run 9 where the feed contains 0.05\u00a0M potassium chloride in addition to 0.20\u00a0M lysine hydrochloride. Inorganic ions in the fermentation broth media are significant impurities in the lysine feed stock. Thus, modeling their behavior is important. It can be seen that the behavior of potassium ion is accurately predicted. As discussed in our previous work 2, potassium ion is displaced by divalent lysine in acidic condition. Therefore, it breaks through unadsorbed at RV\u2009=\u20090.4 in the adsorption train. The lysine desorbed is thus essentially free of potassium ion. It can be noted that the leakage amount of lysine is less than that shown in Run 8 (Fig. 7) without potassium ion. However, this difference is not caused by the existence of potassium ion but by the lower feed flow rate used in Run 9.  Parametric Studies As seen previously, the agreement with the experimental profiles was very good in all cases, suggesting that the model can be used as a tool to explore the effect of operating conditions beyond those investigated experimentally. A comprehensive optimization of the operation is beyond the scope of this work. However, in the following discussion we examine certain important effects. The first effect considered is that of the number of columns and the switch time. For this study, we consider scheme A with a fixed amount of resin and different column numbers. The first case, 1\u20131\u20131\u20131, corresponds to four columns 20\u00a0cm long, the second, 3\u20131\u20133\u20131, corresponds to three columns in the adsorption zone, one in the R1 zone, three in the desorption zone, and one in the R2 zone, and so on. The results are shown in Fig. 9 in terms of the overall lysine recovery yield in the desorbent effluent. As seen in Fig. 9, the optimum switch time decreases as the number of columns is increased. When the switch time is too long, breakthrough occurs from the adsorption train. Conversely, when the switch time is too short, an excessive amount of lysine is lost in the R1 effluent. It can be seen that most of the benefits are accrued with the first few subdivisions of the resin into multiple columns. Going beyond 12 total columns appears to yield diminished returns.

Display full size Figure 9. Simulated lysine recovery yield for scheme A with different number of columns while keeping the total column length constant. The superficial velocity for all zones is set at 0.043\u00a0cm/s.  The second effect is the number of columns and the desorbent velocity in the desorption train. The results are shown in Fig. 10 in terms of the lysine yield loss in the R1 train. This gives the amount of lysine that we would loose because of incomplete desorption. For these calculations, the flow rate in the adsorption train and the switch time were kept constant. It can be seen that as the column number is increased, the minimum desorbent velocity needed to reduce the yield loss to zero decreases. However, there is not much difference between the 1\u20131\u20133\u20131 and the 1\u20131\u20134\u20131 configurations, and it appears that there is an absolute minimum desorbent velocity of 0.006\u00a0cm/s to reduce the yield loss to zero.

The superficial velocity for all zones except the desorption train is set at 0.022\u00a0cm/s. The switch time is 3600\u00a0s.  The third effect studied relates to the ammonia recovery scheme (scheme B in Fig. 1). Simulations were done for the 3\u20131\u20133\u20131 configuration with the velocity kept constant in all zones at 0.0072\u00a0cm/s, except in the R1 column. The effects of the ratio of R1 and D velocities are shown in Fig. 11. It appears that increasing the R1 flow rate reduces ammonia consumption. Up to a certain point, there is no effect on lysine yield. However, beyond that point, the lysine yield decreases substantially. This occurs when the amount of ammonia fed is no longer sufficient to desorb lysine from the resin and leakage in the adsorption train becomes significant. Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin.

The superficial velocity for all zones except the R1 column is set at 0.0072\u00a0cm/s. The switch time is 3600\u00a0s.  The last effect studied is the addition of acid to the end column in the adsorption train (scheme C). As previously discussed, it was suggested that lowering the pH could result in a greater dynamic binding capacity since at low pH lysine would be converted to the more favorably adsorbed divalent cationic form. The increase in dynamic binding capacity with lower pH was seen in the single column experiments discussed in Part II of this work 2. However, it was not seen for the multicolumn experiment in Fig. 7. To understand why this happened, simulations were done for the 3\u20131\u20133\u20131 scheme C by varying the velocity in the adsorption zone. The results are shown in Fig. 12 in terms of the lysine yield loss in the adsorption train effluent. It can be seen that at high velocities, acid addition actually yields greater losses. Conversely, at low velocities acid addition results in a significant reduction of lysine loss. This behavior can be explained as follows. While divalent lysine is favorably adsorbed resulting in a shock wave, the capacity is lower than it is for monovalent lysine. Moreover, the diffusivity of divalent lysine is substantially smaller than is that for the monovalent form. As a result, at high flow rates, when the system is far from equilibrium, the lower adsorption capacity for the divalent form results in an earlier breakthrough. Conversely, at low flow rates, the sharper wave behavior of divalent lysine results in a longer breakthrough time compared to the monovalent form. The experiment in Fig. 7 was for a velocity of 0. 021\u00a0cm/s. As seen in Fig. 12, for this velocity we expect the no acid addition case to yield better performance.

Simulated lysine recovery yield for acid addition scheme C. The superficial velocity is set equal for all zones.   Conclusions The single column model for lysine adsorption and desorption developed in our previous work 2 was extended to the description of a continuous multicolumn ion exchange process. The multicolumn system includes a zone for lysine adsorption and one for lysine desorption, as well as intermediate zones to remove unadsorbed components and excess desorbent, with each zone comprising multiple columns in a simulated countercurrent arrangement. Three cases were considered. In the first, there are no recycle or addition streams so that each zone is coupled only by the periodic switching of columns in a merry\u2010go\u2010round sequence. In the second case, the stream leaving the Rinse 1 zone is mixed with the desorbent feed and recycled, while keeping the same merry\u2010go\u2010round switching of columns. This configuration allows recycling of the excess ammonia present in the columns at the end of a period and reduces the desorbent consumption. In the third case, the same merry\u2010go\u2010round sequence is used. However, prior to entering the last column in the adsorption train, the liquid is acidified to convert lysine to the divalent form, thereby sharpening the breakthrough curve. Lysine hydrochloride solutions are fed to the process with the product being lysine in free\u2010based form. In all three cases, the model was found to be in agreement with experimental results obtained in a bench scale apparatus comprising a total of eight columns. Then, the model was employed to survey the effects of various operating parameters. Firstly, the effect of the simulated counter current motion was tested by changing the number of columns while using constant of resin. The yield of lysine increases as the number of columns in series is increased. However, while there was a large improvement increasing the number of columns from one to two, subsequent increases had a smaller effect. Secondly, the use of multiple columns for desorption was examined. Compared to single column operation, the multicolumn process shows a reduction in the consumption of ammonia by increasing the number of columns in the desorption train. Thirdly, ammonia recovery by recycling the Rinse 1 effluent was shown to reduce the ammonia consumption to one half of the case without ammonia recovery. Lastly, the effects of acid addition on lysine recovery yield were investigated. It was found that the acid addition could prevent the leakage of lysine from the adsorption train up to a certain flow rate beyond which acid addition becomes counterproductive.

The solution includes the effects of film mass-transfer resistance between phases and square-wave temperature cycling in the standing wave mode of operation. The results are in excellent agreement with those obtained by direct numerical integration of the governing partial differential equations. The analytical solution is presented in the form of a convergent series, which is convenient to use.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Present address: Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22901, U.S.A.Copyright \u00a9 1986 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

A kinetic model of the adsorption process was developed, which accounted for protein unfolding and intermolecular interactions in the adsorbed phase. The latter incorporated positive cooperative interactions, resulting from preferred and multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent surface, as well as negative cooperative interactions attributed to exclusion effects due to size exclusion and repulsion. Cooperative adsorption resulted in negative or positive deviations from the Langmuir model for both single and multicomponent isotherms. The model was used to assess possible contributions of different adsorption mechanisms of proteins and their structurally different forms to the overall adsorption pattern, as well as to simulate chromatographic band profiles under different loading conditions.For proteins with unstable structure, the overall adsorption isotherm was dominated by binding of unfolded species at low surface coverage and by positive cooperative adsorption at high surface coverage. Furthermore, regardless of structural stability, exclusion effects influenced strongly adsorption equilibrium, particularly at low surface coverages. In case of chromatographic elution, i.e. under dynamic conditions, unfolding, negative cooperative adsorption, and kinetic effects governed the retention behavior and determined peak shapes, whereas the effect of positive cooperative adsorption was negligible.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsHydrophobic interaction chromatographyCompetitive adsorptionProtein unfoldingMathematical modelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)\u00a9 2020 The Authors.

The model describes mass transfer as a pseudo-steady state diffusion process through a flat film of thickness equal to one fifth of the particle radius. The flux relationships are integrated across the film yielding analytical expressions for the rate of mass transfer in a multicomponent adsorption system. The usefulness of the film model approximation is tested by carrying out calculations for three different practical adsorption systems: the adsorption of n-pentane and n-heptane mixtures on NaCaA zeolite discussed by Marutovsky and B\u00fclow (1987); the adsorption of air in molecular sieve RS-10 discussed by Farooq et al. (1993); and the separation of air in a kinetically-controlled nitrogen PSA process discussed by Farooq and Ruthven (1990) and Sundaram and Yang (1998). In each case, the film model approximation predicts the expected trends accounting for the coupling of diffusion fluxes in the adsorbed phase.\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Gordon Library, WPI\n\nDownload to read the full article text\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferencesCarta, G. and A.

Each of the BiSAb molecules studied exhibited a three-peak elution behavior regardless of the location of scFv attachment to the framework IgG. Collecting and re-injecting each of the isolated peaks and eluting with the same gradient resulted in the same three-peak profile indicating that the behavior is reversible. Analogous behavior was observed for HIC resins with different functional ligands, matrix structures, and particle sizes. Residence time, operating temperature, and hold time were shown to affect the elution behavior. While three peaks were obtained at short residence times and room temperature, residence times longer than about 27\u00a0min or operating at 45\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in a single merged peak indicating that the underlying mechanism occurs on time scales comparable to that of chromatographic separation. Holding the protein on the resins prior to elution enriched the late eluting peak indicating that multiple binding states formed on the chromatographic surface are responsible for this behavior. Tryptophan auto-fluorescence measurements show that stronger binding forms have increased solvent exposure indicating that surface-catalyzed conformational changes play a role. A model was developed to describe the interplay of chromatographic separation and slow conformational changes.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsBispecific antibodiesHicMultiple peak elutionConformational changesMechanistic modelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This article comprises a comprehensive study of IgG adsorption and transport in Repligen CaptivA PriMAB resin with PEGylated ProA ligands that are modified using 5.2 and 21.5\u202fkDa PEG chains. We studied the impact of the molecular weight of the PEG as well as the extent of PEGylation for the 5.2\u202fkDa PEG modification. In all cases, PEGylation of ProA ligands decreases the resin average pore size, particle porosity, and static binding capacity for IgG proportional to the volume of conjugated PEG in the resin. Resin batch uptake experiments conducted in bulk via a stirred-tank system and with individual resin particles under confocal laser scanning microscopy suggests that PEGylation introduces heterogeneity into IgG binding kinetics: a fraction of the IgG binding sites are transformed from typical fast association kinetic behavior to slow kinetic behavior. pH gradient elution experiments of an IgG molecule on the modified resins show an increase in IgG elution pH for all modified resins, implying a decrease in IgG-ProA binding affinity on modification. Despite losses in static binding capacity for all resins with PEGylated ligands, the loss of dynamic binding capacity at 10% breakthrough (DBC10%) ranged more broadly from almost 0\u201347% depending on the PEG molecular weight and the extent of PEGylation. Minimal losses in DBC10% were observed with a low extent of PEGylation with a smaller molecular weight PEG, while higher losses were observed at higher extents of PEGylation and with higher molecular weight PEG due to decreased static binding capacity and increased mass transfer resistance. This work provides insight into the practical implications for resin performance if PEGylation is considered as a strategy for selectivity enhancement in affinity chromatography with macromolecular ligands.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProtein APEGylationAntibodiesAdsorptionBinding kineticsCharacterizationRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Both CHT types contain elongated nanocrystals with size about 20\u2009x\u2009100\u2009nm for Type I and about 50\u2009x\u2009200\u2009nm for Type II. Internal porosities and apparent pore radii based on inverse size exclusion chromatography are 0.73 and 30\u2009nm for Type I and 0.70 and 49\u2009nm for Type II. Adsorption isotherms show maximum capacities of 95 and 110\u2009mg/mL of particle for monomer and dimer on Type I and of 55 and 67\u2009mg/mL of particle on Type II, in approximate agreement with the ratio of surface areas. The isotherms are dependent on the Na+ concentration consistent with an electrostatically driven mechanism. Mixture adsorption shows selectivity toward the dimer, with mean \u03b1-values of 4.3 and 5.8 for Type I and II, respectively. Effective pore diffusivities for non-binding conditions are 0.54\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127 and 0.33\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u2009cm2/s for monomer and dimer in CHT Type I increasing to 0.94\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127 and 0.66\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u2009cm2/s as a result of the larger pore size of Type II. Effective pore diffusivities for strong binding conditions, obtained by confocal microscopy, are much smaller than the non-binding values for Type I but essentially the same for Type II, indicating that diffusional hindrance by the bound protein is greater in the smaller pores of Type I. Mixture confocal adsorption experiments show that the competitive binding kinetics is largely controlled by pore diffusion in both CHT types with the dimer readily displacing the monomer even for strong binging conditions, but is much faster on Type II.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsHydroxyapatiteAntibodiesMonomer and dimerCompetitive bindingMass transferRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Protein load and gradient slope affect both elution peak shape and protein recovery during the gradient. Higher protein loads result in tailing peaks with near 100% recovery that transition to fronting peaks and incomplete recovery as the protein load is reduced. The gradient slope also affects peak shape and recovery. Tailing peaks with lower recovery are obtained with sharper gradients and the most tailing peak and lowest recovery are obtained when step elution rather than gradient is implemented. Modeling the chromatographic elution based on independently determined adsorption isotherms as a function of protein and ammonium sulfate concentration predicts results in agreement with the experimental trends confirming that the unusual chromatographic behavior observed is due to the U-shaped protein binding as a function of the ammonium sulfate concentration. Although less pronounced than in the dilute limit, the U-shaped binding still produces peak shapes and recovery losses as a function of gradient slope that differ from those seen for systems where retention is a monotonic function of salt concentration.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsHydrophobic interaction chromatographyGradient elutionProteinsAntibodiesU-shaped retention factor curvesOverloaded conditionsRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current address: Pfizer, Andover, MA, USA.View Abstract\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A model taking into account competitive binding is developed to predict separation for these conditions. In agreement with the experiments, the model predicts increasingly skewed elution peaks and lower resolution as the protein load increases. However, even at loadings as high as 50% of the column protein binding capacity, high-purity fractions could be collected along the induced pH gradient demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the mixed-bed system.Keywords: induced pH gradientsmixed-bedanion exchangeprotein separationeffect of protein load\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTIONProtein charge variants are a common source of product-related impurities in the industrial-scale production of biopharmaceuticals (1). In general, the industrial separation of charge variants is difficult because their molecular properties are quite similar.While high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with pellicular particles or isoelectric focusing (IEF) can resolve many charge variants, these methods require low protein loads and/or elevated operating pressures that are not suitable for large-scale operations. Chromatographic separations based on low-pressure ion exchange materials with salt gradients are more practical for these operations and have shown some success. Because of the larger particle size of these materials, shallow gradients and low flow rates are often required to provide good resolution.Gradients in pH have also been shown to be effective for the separation of protein charge variants, often exhibiting improved resolution compared to salt gradients. Both salt and pH gradients are usually generated by mixing appropriate buffers in time-varying proportions at the column entrance (2-4). Alternatively, pH gradients can also be generated within the column as a result of interactions of buffer components with the stationary phase (5, 6). In this case, the pH gradient is generated with a step change in pH at the column entrance and propagates through the column at a rate smaller than the mobile phase velocity. Because the protein charge varies with pH, the separated protein species can be focused along the traveling pH wave at pH values where the protein chromatographic velocity equals the local velocity of the pH wave. The ensuing focusing effect results in sharper peaks and thus improved resolution (7, 8). Traveling pH waves of this type can be generated either using buffer species, called ampholytes, that are bound to a strong ion exchange resin and serve as immobilized buffers (9), or using non-interacting buffer species in conjunction with a weak ion exchange resin (9,11-12). In the latter case, the weak ion exchanger provides both buffering capacity, needed to create the pH gradient, and binding sites, needed to retain the protein species. Although both of these approaches have been shown to be effective, several drawbacks exist for each. One drawback is that predicting the separation is difficult because the charges of both the ampholytes (or the weak ion exchange resin) and the protein vary along the pH gradient. Moreover, when using a weak ion exchanger with unretained buffers, the resin charge can become very small at pH extremes along the gradient giving rise to unpredictable and undesirable hydrophobic interactions. Finally, since pH generation and protein retention are based on the same resin functional groups, the protein and buffer counterions compete for binding on the same sites mutually affecting each other and causing distortions of the pH wave at high protein loadings.In our prior work (13, 14), we have shown that some of the limitations of using a weak ion exchanger with unretained buffers for induced pH gradient separations can be overcome with a mixed-bed system comprising a strong ion exchanger with suitably large pores packed together in the same column with a weak ion exchanger with pores sufficiently small to prevent interaction with proteins while still permitting fast exchange of counterions. In such a system, the weak ion exchanger generates the pH gradient as a result of its buffering capacity while the strong ion exchanger provides sites for protein retention. Since the two functions of pH generation and protein retention are effectively decoupled with this approach, flexibility and predictability of the process are improved by allowing each material to be modeled and optimized individually. Vetter et al. (13) demonstrated the mixed-bed approach using columns containing the weak anion exchanger, AG 4-X4 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) in combination with various commercially available strong anion exchangers. Because of the high density of weak base groups in AG 4-X4, only a small percentage (10-15% by volume) of this resin in the mixed-bed was sufficient to create stable and relatively linear pH gradients induced by a pH step at the column entrance using unretained amine buffers. A model was developed to successfully predict the induced pH gradients based solely on the potentiometric titration curve of the AG 4-X4 resin. As a result, the pH gradients could be predicted with the same model parameters for any of the strong anion exchangers tested. The resolution of protein charge variants was also demonstrated experimentally. As a result of the very small size exclusion limit of AG 4-X4, which rendered the weak base ligands essentially inaccessible by the protein, the induced pH gradients were shown to be insensitive to the amount of protein loaded.Vetter et al. (14) developed a model to predict the protein elution behavior by combining mechanistic descriptions of both resin components of the mixed-bed system. The model could successfully predict resolution of protein charge variants but was limited to analytical protein loads, generally less than 0.5 mg/mL of column volume, where retention was adequately described by a linear isotherm relationship and competition among adsorbed protein species could be neglected.The objective of the present work is twofold. The first objective is to empirically determine the effects of protein load on resolution. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) containing a discrete distribution of charge variants was used as a test system using our previously developed mixed-bed column. Resolution was determined as a function of protein load using HPLC, for loads ranging from analytical injections to values comparable in magnitude to the protein equilibrium binding capacity of the strong base resin component of the mixed-bed. The second objective is to develop a model to predict retention and resolution at high protein loads, where protein binding cannot be described by a linear isotherm and competition between charge variants for the strong base resin functional groups cannot be neglected.THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTFor our mixed-bed approach, pH gradient generation and protein binding occur on the two separate resin components, so mutually independent models can be used to describe each phenomenon. These two models are then coupled through the relationship between protein binding and the local values of pH and counterion concentration at each point and time in the mixed-bed.Prediction of Induced pH GradientsThe model used to describe counterion interactions on the weak base resin component of the mixed-bed is the same as that described in Vetter et al. (13) and is based on the following four assumptions: both resins are evenly distributed throughout the column;the buffering species do not interact with either resin;counterion exchange occurs only on the weak base resin; andlocal equilibrium exists for the counterion exchange on the weak base resin. \u2003These four assumptions, validated in our prior work (13) lead to the following equations for amine buffer species with chloride as the counterion:Buffer species deprotonation equilibria (1)  Solution electroneutrality (2)  Chloride-hydroxide exchange equilibrium (3)  Material balances for the column (4) (5) In these equations,  and are, respectively, the total and protonated concentrations of amine buffer species Bi,  is the corresponding deprotonation equilibrium constant, KW is the ionic product of water,  and  are, respectively, the concentration of weak base ligands in the weak anion exchanger and the corresponding deprotonation constant, and u, x, and t are, respectively, the mobile phase superficial velocity, the column length coordinate, and time. The quantity  is the total column porosity where  is the extraparticle porosity of the mixed-bed,  and  are the intraparticle porosities of the weak and strong base resin, respectively, and  is the volume fraction of the weak base resin in the mixed-bed. The q-values in these equations are resin-phase concentrations expressed in terms of solid resin volume, thereby excluding the retention within the intraparticle void space. As shown in our prior work (13,14), these equations can be solved either analytically or numerically. The numerical solution approach was used in this work. The resin properties for this model (= 0.44, = 0.63, = 3.45 mmol/mL resin solid, and = 9.75) were determined experimentally in our previous work (13, 14) while the pKa-values for the amine buffers were those obtained from Beynon and Easterby (15).Prediction of Protein Binding and ElutionProtein binding to the strong base resin component of the mixed-bed is a function of both the local pH and the counterion concentration. Both vary along the pH wave induced by the weak base resin. In our prior work, which was limited to low-load conditions and, hence, linear isotherms, protein binding was described using the stoichiometric displacement model (16, 17), which is based on the assumption that a protein, Pi, with effective binding charge zi displaces zi counterions when binding to the strong base resin according to the following relationship: (6) The following expression was derived for low loadings of each protein i: (7) where  and  are the bound and solution protein concentrations, respectively,  is the resin charge density, and  is the equilibrium constant for the exchange reaction shown in Eq. (6). In our prior work (14), the values of , zi and Ke,i were determined for a native mAb and for a major charge variant based on elution experiments conducted with salt gradients at different pH values using a column packed with the strong base resin. Over a relatively broad pH range (pH 7 to 9), zi was found to be a linear function of pH for each of the two species, while  and the values of Ke,i for each species could be treated as pH-independent constants.The steric mass action law model (SMA) of Brooks and Cramer (18) is used in this work to extend the description of protein binding equilibrium to high protein loads. Accordingly, protein binding in a multicomponent system comprising n species is given by the following equation (19):(8) where  is the so-called hindrance parameter, which is introduced to describe the number of functional groups on the resin surface that are shielded by a bound protein molecule. Since the emphasis of this work is on protein charge variants that have the same size and only small differences in charge, the same value of  independent of pH can be expected for each species.The final component of the model for protein binding to the strong base resin describes the rate of mass transfer. Because of the low diffusivities, pore diffusion is expected to be the main resistance and, thus, the dominant contribution to band broadening. Following our prior work (14), the rate of protein adsorption and desorption is described by the following linear driving force (LDF) model (20): (9) where  is the protein concentration in the strong base resin averaged over the particle volume,  is the effective pore diffusivity, and rp is the resin particle radius.  is the protein solution concentration in equilibrium with  and is obtained from Eq. (8). Since the emphasis of this work is on overloaded conditions, where the -values are large, protein retention in the solution phase within the particle pores is neglected.In order to predict the elution profile for overloaded conditions in the mixed-bed column, the following material balance is written for each protein species: (10) and solved together with Eqs. (8) and (9) using the values of pH and  predicted by the pH gradient model, Eqs. (1)-(5). The combined equations were solved numerically as described in ref. (14) using 100 axial discretization points.EXPERIMENTALMaterialsThe resins used in this work, AG 4-X4 from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA) and SOURCE 30Q from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA), are the same as those used in our prior work (14). The relevant resin properties are summarized in Table 1. AG 4-X4 is a weak anion exchanger with trimethylamine functional groups on irregularly shaped particles 50\u2013200 \u00b5m in size, and features a 1.4 kDa size exclusion limit. SOURCE 30Q is a strong anion exchanger with quaternary amine functional groups on poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) spherical particles with an average diameter of 28 \u03bcm, and large pores that provide a high size exclusion limit.Resolution of Protein Charge Variants in Mixed-Bed Chromatography Columns with Step-Induced pH Gradients at High Protein LoadingsAll authorsTarl A.

Summary of relevant resin properties\nDownload CSVDisplay Table All buffer chemicals were of ACS reagent grade and were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). For this work, the test protein was a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IgG1, Mr ~ 150 kDa, pI ~ 8.2) provided by MedImmune (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA) indicates that the mAb sample was essentially 100% monomer. However, isoelectric focusing with precast IsoGel\u00ae Agarose IEF plates (pH 7-11) from Lonza, Inc. (Allandale, NJ, USA) show the presence of a main charge variant with pI ~ 8.0 plus additional minor charge variants with lower pI (14). HPLC analyses were conducted on a Model e2695 system from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA, USA) using a ProPac WCX-10 pellicular CEX column obtained from Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a 26 CV gradient from 0 to 40 mM NaCl in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.75. Figure 1 shows a typical HPLC analysis result for the mAb feedstock. Based on the areas of the three main peaks, the crude mAb contains about 70% of the native species (assumed to be the largest of the three peaks) as well as two main variants, V1 and V2, corresponding to about 23 and 7% of the total protein. As discussed in our prior work (13,14), the variants are likely a result of deamidation of the native protein. Accordingly, the protein net charge becomes more negative for the variants, resulting in weaker retention and, thus, earlier elution on the analytical CEX column.Resolution of Protein Charge Variants in Mixed-Bed Chromatography Columns with Step-Induced pH Gradients at High Protein LoadingsAll authorsTarl A.

HPLC analysis of mAb feedstock with a ProPac WCX-10 pellicular CEX column. Three main peaks are identified as the native mAb (70%), variants V1 (23%), and V2 (7%) of the total area. The buffers in this study contained a 95/5 ratio of ethanolamine (pKa = 9.50 at 25\u00b0C) and Tris (pKa = 8.06 at 25\u00b0C) that were prepared by titrating HCl solutions of known concentration to the desired pH values with the amine species in free-base form. As shown in our prior work (13,14), this ratio yields a pH gradient of reasonable duration with sufficient buffering capacity at both ends of the gradient. Since temperature affects the pKa values of the amine buffers used, the temperature was carefully monitored, with all experiments conducted at room temperature, 24 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. A glass combination electrode (S20 SevenEasy pH, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) was used to measure the pH with a precision of \u00b1 0.01 pH units.MethodsAdsorption IsothermsBatch isotherm experiments were conducted for the mAb on SOURCE 30Q at pH 9.0, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.5 using buffers with 15, 30, and 50 mM ethanolamine. The resin was first equilibrated with each buffer and then centrifuged for 12 minutes at 5000 rpm in 1.5 mL filter vials to remove liquid from the resin particles. Separate 1.5-mL mAb samples with protein concentrations between 0.1 and 3.0 mg/mL were buffer-exchanged using 30,000 MWCO ultrafiltration centrifuge vials and added to 1.7-mL vials together with 10 to 75 mg of resin and mixed continuously on a rotating wheel at 30-60 rpm for 20 hours. After equilibration, the vials were centrifuged for two minutes at 5000 rpm to settle out the resin. The supernatant mAb concentration was then determined from the UV absorbance at 280 nm using a 5 mm quartz cuvette, with dilutions made to keep the absorbance less than or equal to 1 to ensure linearity of response. The total protein bound to the resin for each condition was then calculated by mass balance.Mixed-Bed pH Gradient Based SeparationsMixed-beds of AG 4-X4 and SOURCE 30Q were prepared as described in refs. (13,14) in a 5 mm diameter x 200 mm long Tricorn column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) The column used for the experiments in this work contained 14 vol.% AG 4-X4 and had a bed height of 20.2 cm. The experiments were conducted using an \u00c4KTA Explorer 10 from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the following procedure. The mixed-bed was first equilibrated with about 30 column volumes (CV) of the high pH buffer, which contained 15 mM Cl\u2212 and a 95/5 mixture of ethanolamine and Tris at pH 9.0. The crude mAb, dissolved in the initial buffer at a concentration of 8.6 mg/mL was then loaded to the column in volume sufficient to achieve protein loads between 0.45 and 21.5 mg/mL of total column volume. After a 5 CV wash with the load buffer, the mobile phase was stepped to a pH 7 buffer also containing 15 mM Cl\u2212 and a 95/5 mixture of ethanolamine and Tris. The flow rate was kept at 1 mL/min for all steps, corresponding to a superficial velocity of 300 cm/h. Elution was monitored with the UV, conductivity, and pH detectors of the \u00c4KTA Explorer 10 unit. The UV detector signal was converted to protein concentration using the mAb extinction coefficient, 1.49 AU/(mg/mL), according to Lambert-Beer\u2019s law. In addition, fractions collected at various time intervals were buffer exchanged to pH 6.75 phosphate and analyzed by HPLC with a ProPac WCX pellicular CEX column as described in Section titled \u201cMaterials\u201d to determine their composition. Note that, obviously, the order of elution in the ProPac CEX column, where the charge variants elute earlier than the main native species, is opposite to the order of elution along the pH gradient in the mixed-bed AEX column, where the charge variants elute later.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAdsorption IsothermsFigure 2 shows the batch isotherms for adsorption of the crude mAb mixture on SOURCE 30Q at different pH values and chloride concentrations in 95/5 ethanolamine/Tris mixed buffers. As expected, the highest protein binding occurs at the highest pH, where the protein has the highest negative charge, and at the lowest chloride concentration, where competition by the chloride counterions is lowest. Note that significant binding occurs even at or below the mAb pI, indicating that protein binding is likely a result of clustered negatively charged residues on specific portions of the protein surface.Resolution of Protein Charge Variants in Mixed-Bed Chromatography Columns with Step-Induced pH Gradients at High Protein LoadingsAll authorsTarl A.

Adsorption isotherms for the crude mAb feedstock on SOURCE 30Q at pH 9.0 (a), 8.5 (b), 8.0 (c), and 7.5 (d) in 95/5 ethanolamine/Tris buffers containing different chloride concentrations. The total bound protein concentration shown on the y-axis, , is expressed in mg per mL of resin particle volume. Lines are based on the three-component SMA model Eq. (8) with parameters described in the text. The parameters used to describe the adsorption isotherm data in terms of the SMA model were determined as follows. The mAb binding behavior at low loadings on SOURCE 30Q was determined in our previous work (14) for purified samples of the native species (N) and of the main variant (V1) using salt gradient elution chromatography at different pH values. These determinations yielded the following values for the resin charge density, , the equilibrium constants,  and , and for the protein effective charge values,  and , valid at pH values between 7.5 and 9:The same parameters were used in this work to describe the isotherm data. However, for improved accuracy, based on the HPLC analysis in Fig. 1 and on the pH gradient elution behavior discussed below, at least a second variant must be included in the description of the mAb binding behavior. Since no data for the behavior of this second, minor variant are available, the following two simplifying assumptions were made. The first assumption is that the ratio of ion exchange equilibrium constants of the two variants, , can be taken to be equal to the ratio . The second assumption is that the difference in effective charge between the two variants, , can be taken to be equal to the difference . According to these assumptions, we then have: Although empirical, these assumptions are thought to be consistent with the origin of the charge variants present in the mAb sample, which, as discussed above, are likely related to deamidation. With increasing deamidation, a homologous series of variants with increasingly more negative charge (and, hence, higher z) are produced resulting in stronger retention and tailing elution profiles in the mixed-bed AEX column. With these assumptions, the only remaining parameters in the SMA expression for a three-component system, Eq. (8), are the -values. Since the variants have the same size and similar charge, we assumed the same  for all three species and determined best-fit value of  = 75 by regressing the isotherm data. Since the selectivity is expected to be small and the change in solution concentration upon adsorption was generally less than 30%, we assumed that the percentage of each species in the equilibrated bulk solution was the same as that present in the mAb feedstock. As seen in Fig. 2, the three-component SMA model provides a reasonably accurate description of protein binding as a function of pH, protein concentration, and chloride concentration.Mixed-Bed pH Gradient Based SeparationsFigures 3-6 show the results of mixed-bed pH gradient based chromatographic separations at increasing protein loadings from 0.45 to 21.5 mg/mL. It should be noted that, based on the isotherm data and accounting for the extraparticle porosity and the fraction of SOURCE 30Q in the column, the maximum mixed-bed column mAb binding capacity is on the order of 40 mg/mL of mixed-bed volume at pH 9 and 15 mM Cl-. Thus the protein loads used in induced pH gradient runs span the range from an analytical injection at 0.45 mg/mL to conditions where about half of the column protein binding capacity is used. The data at the lowest protein load (0.45 mg/mL, Fig. 3) are the same as those reported in Fig. 6c in ref. (14). The lines show the predictions based on the full isotherm model using the effective pore diffusivity  cm2/s, determined in our prior work (14), for all three protein species. All other model parameters were as described above. Because of the small protein load used in this case, the model lines are indistinguishable from those obtained from our previous linear-isotherm model (14) indicating that the full model extrapolates to the correct dilute limit. Although model predictions somewhat underestimate the elution pH, the predicted peak shape is in good agreement with the experimental data. It should be noted that predicting retention in these systems is inherently difficult, since protein binding is very sensitive to both pH and counterion concentration, so that even small errors in predicting the latter values can translate to large errors in predicted protein retention. Figure 4 shows the results for an 8.6-mg/mL protein load along with the purity of selected fractions determined by HPLC. For these conditions, the eluted peak becomes more skewed and elutes earlier in the gradient as a result of the overloaded conditions. As seen in this figure, fractions with high purity in the native species and fractions enriched in the two variants were collected at various points along the pH gradient. Model predictions using the same parameters as those used in Fig. 3 are consistent with the experimental results. Although the elution pH is somewhat underestimated, the peak shape is predicted well. Figures 5 and 6 at further increased protein loads of 15 and 21.5 mg/mL, respectively, show the same general trends. As the protein load is increased, the peak elutes earlier and becomes even more skewed, resulting in less effective separation, consistent with model predictions. As seen in these figures, the model prediction becomes closer to the data as the load is increased. We believe that this is a result of the improved accuracy of the isotherm model at high protein loads (see Fig. 2). The behavior of the variants becomes more complicated as loading increases. In particular, as seen in Fig. 6, the native protein interferes with the elution of variant V1 as a result of competitive binding. Interference is much less significant between variant V1 and variant V2 as the concentrations of these variants is low and competitive binding effects are less important.Purities calculated from the model at 100% recovery of the native protein for the data in Figs. 3-6 are 87%, 86%, 81%, and 77% at total protein loads of 0.45, 8.6, 15, and 21.5 mg/mL, respectively. The decline of purity with load is obviously significant as the column binding capacity is approached. However, as seen in Figs. 3-6, even at the highest load, fractions with high purity in the native form are still obtained along with fractions that are highly enriched in the variants. Thus, a high-purity product can be collected at high loads by sacrificing some yield.As seen in Figs. 3-6, variation in the protein load has no significant effect on the induced pH gradient. In fact, for all four cases the experimental pH profiles are consistent with the same model prediction confirming that decoupling of pH gradient generation and protein binding has been effectively achieved.

CONCLUSIONSThe operability of a mixed-bed column for the chromatographic separations of protein charge variants with induced pH gradients is demonstrated over a broad range of protein loads, from analytical injections to loads as high as 50% of the column equilibrium protein binding capacity. The mixed-bed system, comprising a mixture of a small-pore weak base resin and a large-pore strong base resins, combines the simplicity and reliability of a pH step elution process with the high resolution capability of a pH gradient operation. Decoupling of the pH gradient generating function of the small-pore weak base resin and the protein binding function of the strong base resin, results in induced pH gradients that are unaffected by the protein load. Moreover, decoupling the two functions allows for the independent characterization and modeling of the phenomena occurring in each resin. For the resolution of the charge variants present in a model mAb, separation of these closely related species is attained in a laboratory scale column. Consistent with model predictions based on parameters determined separately for each resin component, resolution decreases as the protein load increases as a result of competitive binding and non-linear isotherm behavior. Even at the highest load used, however, fractions with high purity in the native mAb and fractions highly enriched in the variants are obtained along the induced pH gradient. Model predictions based on an extension of our previously developed linear model by incorporating the SMA model to describe competitive binding for overloaded conditions, are found to be in substantial agreement with the experimental trends providing a tool to assess the ability of different strong base resins to achieve resolution in the mixed-bed system based on independently determined retention, equilibrium, and rate parameters.NOMENCLATUREmobile phase concentration (mmol/mL)mobile phase concentration in equilibrium with the protein concentration in the particle (mmol/mL)number of column volumes passedeffective diffusivity (cm2/s)deprotonation equilibrium constant for amine buffer Bi (mmol/mL)equilibrium constant in stoichiometric displacement model, Eq.

The approach effectively decouples intracolumn generation of pH gradients, which ensues from ionic interactions with the weak base resin, from protein separation, which ensues from interactions with the strong base resin ligands, resulting in a process that is more easily predictable, less prone to the effects of protein loading on the pH gradient, less susceptible to hydrophobic interactions between protein and resin surface, and more flexible. The approach is demonstrated successfully using a tertiary amine resin as the weak base component together with a range of commercial strong anion exchangers with quaternary amine functionality. A predictive model, based on the potentiometric titration of the weak base resin, is in excellent agreement with experimentally determined pH profiles obtained using mixed-bed columns and amine buffers with pH steps from 9 to 7. The separation of protein charge variants with the mixed-bed concept is demonstrated using these columns for a deamidated monoclonal antibody mixture, which yielded highly homogeneous fractions. Keywords: anion exchangeinduced pH gradientsmixed-bedprotein separation\n\n\n\n\n INTRODUCTION pH gradient based ion exchange chromatography has been shown effective for the separation of protein charge variants such as those arising from post translational modifications (1\u20133). In addition to providing selectivities different from those attainable with salt gradients, pH gradients allow separation at low ionic strengths, which may simplify further downstream processing. There are two fundamentally different ways of imple-menting such pH gradients. The first relies on an externally generated gradient obtained by mixing two mobile phases in a time-varying ratio at the column entrance. The second uses a gradient generated within the column as a result of interactions between mobile phase components and the stationary phase in response to a step change at the column entrance. Although induced pH gradients of this second type can be obtained either with a strong ion exchanger and a suitable mixture of retained buffering species or with a weak ion exchanger and non-retained buffering species, the latter is considered simpler and more easily predictable. In addition to the operational advantage of a simple step change compared to the time-varying mixing required with externally generated gradients, induced pH gradients result in a pH wave that propagates through the column at a rate slower than the mobile phase velocity. In this case, individual species can be focused along the traveling pH wave concentrating them at pH values where the pH wave velocity and the species chromatographic velocities are equal. Separations based on such \u201cchromatofocusing\u201d techniques were initially described by Sluyterman and Elgersma (4) and Sluyterman and Wijdenes (5). Practical aspects are discussed by Liu and Anderson (6). Frey and co-workers (7\u20139) developed models to describe pH transitions in chromatography columns and described several protein separations using anion exchange resins, but primarily using stationary phases with small particles designed for analytical chromatography. Induced pH gradients have been shown by Pabst et al. (10, 11) to be effective at resolving charge variants for glycosylated proteins and for monoclonal antibodies, with both weak cation and weak anion exchange columns using low-pressure stationary phases. Induced pH gradients generated with weak ion exchange columns also have some potential disadvantages; that can arise from the fact that the ligands responsible for generating pH gradients within the column are normally also responsible for the interactions that lead to protein separation. First, it is difficult to predict protein retention since the stationary phase charge changes along with pH. Second, protein binding itself can affect the pH gradient, leading to distortions of the induced pH profile that become more significant as the protein load increases. Third, the resin can become uncharged at extreme pH values along the pH gradient introducing the possibility of undesirable nonspecific hydrophobic interactions between protein molecules and the resin surface. In order to overcome these limitations, in this work we examine the behavior of mixed-bed columns that utilize two different resins, each specially selected to perform independently one of the two functions required\u2014ionic interactions with mobile phase components leading to the generation of pH gradients and interactions with protein species leading to their separation. The mixed-bed concept is shown schematically in Fig. 1 with reference to the case of anion exchange with non-adsorbed buffering species. In this case, the column comprises a weak anion exchanger with pores small enough to completely exclude protein molecules and a strong anion exchanger with pores sufficiently large to allow protein diffusion and interaction with charged ligands on the resin. As in the case of a column containing a single weak anion exchanger, the pH gradient is induced by a step change at the column entrance, which generates both an axial pH gradient along the column and a temporal gradient at the column outlet. In this case, however, the small-pore weak anion exchanger alone modulates the pH, while the strong base resin alone is responsible for protein binding and separation. In principle, protein binding can still occur to some extent on the outer surface of the weak exchanger. However, since the external surface area of moderately sized resin beads is negligible compared to the area within the resin's pores, protein binding on the weak exchanger is likely insignificant, approximating an ideal system where the pH gradient generation and protein binding are effectively decoupled. In turn, predictability is improved since each resin component can be studied independently, the effect of protein loading on the pH gradient can be virtually eliminated since protein binding occurs on ligands different from those used to modulate pH, and the possibility of hydrophobic interactions at pH extremes can be greatly reduced since the strong anion exchanger, which contains virtually all of the protein accessible surface area, remains charged across broad ranges of pH. Additionally, the same weak anion exchanger can be combined with different strong anion exchangers in proportions that best balance pH gradient generation and protein-ligand interactions. Obviously, analogous effects can be obtained with the combination of a weak, small pore cation exchanger and suitably large-pore cation exchanger, or by combining weak and strong functionalities in a single bead whose architecture prevents proteins from interacting with the weak functional group.

The sketches on the left-hand side show from top to bottom the inlet pH, the pH and protein concentration profiles along the column length at a particular time, and the outlet pH, respectively.   The objective of this work is thus fourfold. The first is to demonstrate that mixed-beds of weak and strong anion exchangers can be obtained with a uniform distribution of resin components along the column lengths and radius. The second is to demonstrate that these columns can be used to generate reproducible pH gradients with non-retained buffering species. The third is to provide a model to predict the pH gradients as a function of column and mobile phase compositions. The fourth is to demonstrate the mixed-bed column separation of the charge variants of a monoclonal antibody.  THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT The model used to describe pH gradients generated with non-retained buffering species in mixed-bed columns is an extension of the model developed by Pabst et al. (10) for weak anion exchange columns. The main assumptions are: 1. the mixed-bed has a spatially uniform composition;2. the buffering species are unretained;3. exchange of chloride and hydroxide ions occurs only on the weak anion exchanger while the strong anion exchanger remains in the chloride form; and4. mass transfer of counterions and buffering species is rapid so that local equilibrium exists for these species between the mobile phase and the stationary phase.  The pH is then found by considering solution and ion exchange equilibria together with differential balances according to the relationships in the following sections.  Solution Equilibria Considering a system containing chloride as the counterion with a mixture of monobasic buffering species, the relevant solution equilibria are modeled by the following equations    describing deprotonation of the amine buffers, a material balance on the total buffer species, water splitting into hydronium and hydroxide ions, and the solution electroneutrality condition, respectively. In these equations, K  a, B  i   is the deprotonation constant for buffering species i,  the corresponding total concentration, C  B  i   and C  B  i  H +  the corresponding concentrations of the neutral and protonated forms, respectively, and K  w  the ionic product of water. Combining Eqs. (1), (2), and (3) with Eq. (4), yields the following relationship:    which can be solved for C  H +  for given values of C  Cl \u2212  and . The pH can then be calculated as:    where \u03b3 H +  is the activity coefficient, which, in turn, can be estimated as a function of ionic strength from the following equation (13):    A is the Debye-H\u00fcckle constant, equal to 0.51 at 298\u00a0K (13), and I is the ionic strength of the solution.   Ion Exchange Equilibria Ion exchange equilibria on the weak base resin are described by the following relationships:    subject to the Donnan equilibrium condition (14):    where K  a, R  is the deprotonation constant for the resin's weak base functional groups,  their total concentration, q  R  and q  RH +  are the corresponding concentrations of deprotonated and protonated forms, and q  H + , q  OH \u2212 , and q  Cl \u2212  are the resin-phase concentrations of hydrogen, hydroxide, and chloride ions, respectively. All q-values in these equations are expressed per unit volume of resin solid; i.e. excluding both extraparticle and intraparticle pore volumes. Since, in practice, both q  H +  and q  OH \u2212  are much smaller than (14), combining Eqs. (8) through (11) yields:     As shown by Pabst et al. (10), analogous but more complicated relationships are obtained for weak base resins containing multiple functional groups with different pK  a, R  values or when deprotonation of one group affects deprotonation of the others. In this work we consider only the simplest case, which proved adequate for the weak anion exchanger used. We assume that no exchange of chloride occurs on the functional groups of the strong base resin as these groups are fully protonated and Cl\u2212 is in excess as long as the pH is less than 12.   Conservation Equations Neglecting axial dispersion, material balances for the conserved species, which are the total of each buffering species, B i , and Cl\u2212, are given by the following equations:    In these equations, u is the superficial mobile phase velocity, x is the column axial coordinate, t is time, \u03f5 t  is the total column porosity, \u03d5 w  is the volume fraction of the weak resin component of the mixed-bed, and \u03f5 p, w  is the corresponding intraparticle porosity. The total column porosity is given by \u03f5 t \u00a0=\u00a0\u03f5 + (1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03f5)[\u03d5 w \u03f5 p, w \u00a0+\u00a0(1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03d5 w )\u03f5 p, s ] where \u03f5 is the extraparticle porosity and \u03f5 p, s  the intraparticle porosity of the strong base resin.   Solution Methods Two different methods were used to solve the conservation equations. An analytical solution was obtained by the method of characteristics. Accordingly, the characteristic velocities, obtained from Eqs. (13) and (14) are:    for the unretained buffering species,    for simple chloride waves, and    for chloride shock waves. In Eq. (17), \u0394 represents differences between values upstream and downstream of a shock. The values of dq  Cl \u2212 /dC  Cl \u2212  and \u0394q  Cl \u2212 /\u0394C  Cl \u2212  are determined numerically from the combined solution and ion exchange equilibrium relationships, Eqs. (1) through (12). As discussed in (15, 16), for a step change in buffer composition from  to  and  to  the solution consists of two waves \u2013 a fast wave traveling at velocity u/\u03f5 t  with  and  where  is an intermediate chloride concentration determined by setting \u0394q  Cl \u2212 \u00a0=\u00a00; and a slow wave with  along which the chloride concentration changes from  to . The slow wave can be a gradual wave, a shock wave, or a combination of both dependent on whether v  c, Cl \u2212  increases, decreases, or has a minimum as a function of the axial coordinate x. Once the appropriate wave type and velocity is determined, the number of column volumes that correspond to a particular outlet chloride concentration and pH are calculated as either CV\u00a0=\u00a0u/v  c  or CV\u00a0=\u00a0u/v  s . In general, a simple wave, which corresponds to a smooth pH gradient, is obtained with buffers whose pK  a  is larger than the operating pH (10, 11, 16). A numerical solution of the conservation equation was also obtained by discretizing the axial derivative by backwards-finite differences and solving the resulting ordinary differential equations in time using Gear's method with subroutine DVIPAG of IMSL\u00ae Numerical Libraries (Rogue Wave Software, Boulder, CO, USA) as described by Pabst and Carta (15). The discretization introduces numerical dispersion, which simulates qualitatively the effects of axial dispersion in the column. Increasing the number of discretization points, N, reduces numerical dispersion giving a solution that should approximate the analytical result.   MATERIALS AND METHODS  Materials The resins used in this work are AG 4-X4, Nuvia Q, and UNOsphere DQ from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA), and Q Sepharose FF and SOURCE 30Q from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Their basic properties are summarized in Table 1. AG 4X-4 is a weak anion exchanger based on acrylic polymers with trimethylamine functional groups. The resin has 4% crosslinkage, 100\u2013200 dry mesh size, and an irregular particle shape with hydrated size in the range 50\u2013200\u00a0\u00b5m. The supplier-reported size exclusion limit is 1,400 Dalton. As a result, the resin is expected to exclude most proteins. On the other hand, since diffusion of small counterions and buffering species through this resin is likely to be fast, neither the particle shape nor the exact size are expected to affect the results. The remaining four resins are strong anion exchangers with quaternary amine functional groups. Q Sepharose FF is agarose based, SOURCE 30Q is based on poly(styrene-divinyl benzene), and Nuvia Q is a polymer grafted matrix based on a large-pore polymeric backbone. UNOsphere DQ is an experimental open-pore strong anion exchanger based on a backbone matrix similar to that of Nuvia Q but without polymeric surface extenders. Mixed-Beds of Strong and Weak Anion Exchange Resins for Protein Separations with Step-Induced pH GradientsAll authorsTarl A.

A purified monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IgG1, M  r \u00a0\u223c\u00a0150\u00a0kDa, pI \u223c8.2) was obtained from MedImmune (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The mAb was found to be essentially 100% monomer by size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA) and chromatographically pure by salt gradient elution cation exchange chromatography with a SOURCE 30S column (also from GE Healthcare) at pH 5. However, the mAb was found to contain two significant charge variants with lower pI values (8.0 and 7.8, accounting for about 20% and 5%, respectively, of the total protein), which could be distinguished by isoelectric focusing with precast IsoGel\u00ae Agarose IEF plates (pH 7\u201311) from Lonza, Inc. (Allandale, NJ, USA). In order to accentuate the effects of the charge variants, the mAb was also forcibly deamidated by incubating it at room temperature in a 1\u00a0M Tris solution at pH 9 for 7 days. The forced deamidation increased the fractions of the two original charge variants to 35% and 20% of the total mAb, respectively, and generated significant amounts of an additional variant with an IEF band corresponding to a pI of about 7.6, representing 10% of the total. All experiments were conducted at room temperature, 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0C. Since temperature affects the pK  a  values of the amine buffers used, the temperature was carefully monitored with a thermocouple inserted in a tee fitting at the column outlet.   Methods  Resin Properties Inverse size exclusion chromatography (iSEC) was used to determine the size exclusion limit and intraparticle porosity of each resin as suggested by Hagel et al. (17) using glucose and dextran standards with molecular masses between 4 and 2,000\u00a0kDa and corresponding estimated hydrodynamic radii between 1.7 and 40\u00a0nm. A Model e2695 HPLC system from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA, USA) with a Model 2414 refractive index detector was used for this purpose. Solutions containing 5\u00a0g/L of each standard were prepared in the 20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 running buffer. 30\u00a0\u00b5L samples were injected at 150\u00a0cm/hr. The distribution coefficient was then calculated for each solute from the following expression:    where V  R  is the retention volume at the peak maximum, V  col  is the column volume, and \u03f5 is the extraparticle porosity. The latter was determined from the retention volume of 2,000\u00a0kDa dextran for the smaller pore resins or from pressure-flow curves using the Kozeny-Carman equation for the larger pore resins UNOsphere DQ and SOURCE 30Q. The intraparticle porosity was taken to be equal to K  D  for glucose while the size exclusion limit was taken as the dextran hydrodynamic radius giving K  D \u00a0=\u00a00. Potentiometric titrations were used to determine the weak base content of each resin. For this purpose, a sample of each resin was packed in a 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0mm column and equilibrated with a 0.1\u00a0M NaCl solution at pH 11. After removing the column bottom adapter, the resin was then extruded into a beaker containing 25\u00a0mL of the equilibration solution and titrated potentiometrically with 0.05\u00a0M HCl. The resin weak base content  and its apparent pK  a  were determined by fitting the resulting titration curves to Eq. (12). As discussed below, only AG 4-X4 showed significant weak base content between pH 6 and 11.    Preparation and Characterization of Mixed-Bed Columns Mixed-bed and single resin columns were packed in 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050 or 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0mm Tricorn columns from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA) using an \u00c4KTA Explorer 10 unit also from GE Healthcare. For columns packed with a single resin, a 50% slurry was poured into the column fitted with a packing extender and then flow-packed at the velocities recommended by the resin suppliers. Mixed-beds of AG 4-X4 with a strong base resin were packed by first collecting samples of each hydrated resin in the desired volumetric ratio from slurries with known concentrations. The two mixed resins were then re-suspended in buffer to create a 50% slurry which was then flow-packed as for the single resin columns. Mixed-bed columns with ratios on the order of 1:1 were packed at the manufacturer specified velocity for the material with lower mechanical strength. In the case of mixed-beds with ratios on the order of 1:10, the manufacturer specified packing velocity for the major component was used. The distribution of AG 4-X4 in mixed-beds was visualized using optical microscopy with a procedure similar to that described by Corbett et al. (18). For this purpose, mixed resin samples were packed in 1\u00a0mL plastic syringe bodies (4\u00a0mm internal diameter) fitted with a fiberglass frit to retain the resin to a depth of 2 to 3.6\u00a0cm. Each packed column was then dehydrated by passing 10 to 20\u00a0mL each of 20%, 67%, and 100% aqueous ethanol solutions and then saturated with LR White polyester resin (London Resin Company, London, UK) dissolved in ethanol with increasing concentration from zero to 100%. After saturation with LR White, the column was sealed and placed in a 45\u00b0C oven for 3 days to cure. Once cured, the embedded column was cut longitudinally along the column center using a jeweler's saw. The cut faces were then polished with 4000 grit finishing cloth using a Buehler EcoMet 3000 polisher (Lake Bluff, IL, USA), stained using FD&C Blue 1 dye (General Mills Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), which is negatively charged, and photographed at 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0magnification with a Nikon Eclipse E-200 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, NY, USA).   Induced pH Gradients As in the case of columns containing a single weak base resin, pH gradients were generated within mixed-bed columns by applying step changes at the column entrance from pH 9 to pH 7 while keeping a constant chloride concentration at superficial velocities between 150 and 450\u00a0cm/hr using an \u00c4KTA Explorer 10 unit. Ethanolamine, Tris, and BisTris were used as buffers for these experiments either alone or as a mixture. The corresponding pK  a  values are 9.50, 8.06, and 6.46, respectively, at 298\u00a0K (19). Corrections to these values for deviations from 298\u00a0K were made according to the parameters provided by Beynon and Easterby (19), namely: \u22120.029, \u22120.028, and \u22120.020\u00b0C\u22121 for ethanolamine, Tris, and BisTris, respectively. These buffers were selected because they are either neutral or cationic, preventing interaction with the anion exchangers, and because their pK  a  values span across the range of initial and final pH used in our experiments. Buffer solutions containing mixtures of ethanolamine with Tris or BisTris were prepared by first adding weighed amounts of either Tris or BisTris in free-base form (calculated based on Eqs. (1\u20137)) to HCl solutions having a known chloride concentration and then titrating these solutions with ethanolamine until the desired pH was reached. Conductivity, which corresponds closely to the chloride concentration, and pH were monitored at the column outlet with in-line pH and conductivity probes. The effluent pH was also checked off-line by collecting fractions of the column effluent. Good agreement was found between in-line and off-line measurements.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Resin Properties The intraparticle porosity and size exclusion limit determined for each of the resins used in this work are given in Table 1. AG 4-X4 excluded all of the dextran standards except for the 4\u00a0kDa dextran while all of the strong base resins had relatively large exclusion limits. Among these, Nuvia Q is an exception having a relatively small size exclusion limit. However, this resin contains charged polymer grafts that have been shown for similar matrices to exclude neutral macrosolutes but still effectively bind oppositely charged proteins (20, 21). Figure 2 shows the potentiometric titration curves for the resins used in this work. The sloped portion provides the pH range over which the resin has buffering capacity resulting from the protonation of weak base groups while the plateau provides the concentration of these groups. It is evident that only AG 4-X4 has significant buffering capacity over a useful pH range, while the strong base resins give titration curves close to the blank titration indicated by the dashed line. The solid line in Fig. 2 is based on Eq. (12) with fitted values of pK  a, R \u00a0=\u00a09.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 and \u00a0mmol per mL of resin solid. This  value can be converted to a bed volume basis multiplying it times the quantity (1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03f5)(1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03f5 p )\u00a0=\u00a0(1\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.33)(1\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.44)\u00a0=\u00a00.38 giving a weak base group content of 1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mmol per mL of packed bed. This value is about 10 times greater than that previously reported in Pabst et al. (10) for DEAE Sepharose FF and for ANX Sepharose FF, which were used for pH gradient based separations of protein charge variants. The high value obtained for AG 4-X4 suggests that a small percentage of this resin can be used in a mixed-bed with a strong base resin to obtain induced pH gradients similar to those of Pabst et al. (10). As seen in Fig. 2, using a single pK  a  value for the resin's functional groups provides agreement within experimental error especially in the practical pH range of 7 to 9 indicating that a more complicated description of protonation of the resin, as suggested by Pabst et al. (10, 11), is not warranted in this case. Mixed-Beds of Strong and Weak Anion Exchange Resins for Protein Separations with Step-Induced pH GradientsAll authorsTarl A.

Mixed-Bed Packing Characterization Figure 3 shows microphotographs of mixed-bed columns containing 10% AG 4-X4 that were embedded, cut longitudinally along the column center, and stained with FD&C Blue 1 dye as described in the Methods section of this paper. Because of their large exchange ligand density, the AG 4-X4 particles are stained dark blue and are visible as irregular shapes against the background of UNOsphere DQ and SOURCE 30S which are only lightly stained. The images show that the AG 4-X4 particles are generally randomly distributed across both column length and diameter with no obvious agglomeration or preferential distribution. Similar results are obtained when mixing AG 4-X4 with either UNOsphere DQ or SOURCE 30Q, despite the large difference in particle size, size distribution, and shape. Thus, the assumption that the mixed-bed columns are composed of two well-dispersed materials appears appropriate.

Induced pH Gradients In order to demonstrate the versatility of the mixed-bed approach, results are presented in Figs. 4 through 7 for AG 4-X4 in combination with different strong base resins varying the percentage of AG 4-X4, the buffer chloride concentration, and the buffer type and composition. In each case, the experimental pH and chloride concentration profiles, obtained from the in-line pH and conductivity probes as described by Pabst et al. (10), are compared with predictions based on the analytical solution of the model equations, Eqs. (1) through (14), obtained by the method of characteristics.

Figure 4 shows the effect of using different proportions of AG 4-X4 and Q Sepharose FF for ethanolamine buffers containing 50\u00a0mM chloride. As seen in this figure, smooth pH transitions are obtained in all three cases although longer transitions are achieved with higher percentages of AG 4-X4. For practical applications, a particular percentage of AG 4-X4 can be selected to yield a desired gradient. Although the mobile phase residence time, L/u, is only 1\u20134\u00a0min, the experimental results are in close agreement with the analytical solution of the model equations indicating that neither mass transfer nor axial dispersion play a significant role for these conditions. Close agreement with the model also confirms that interactions of the mobile phase component with the strong base resin Q Sepharose FF have negligible effects so that the pH transitions are due exclusively to the AG 4-X4 resin. Figure 5 shows the effects of buffer composition for mixtures of ethanolamine and Tris with 15\u00a0mM chloride for a mixed bed containing 10% AG 4-X4 and 90% Nuvia Q. Increasing the percentage of Tris in the buffer sharpens the induced pH gradient. This behavior is a result of the lower pK  a , and, hence, greater buffering capacity of Tris compared to ethanolamine, which causes the slow pH wave to travel faster through the column. As in the previous case, quantitative agreement with model predictions is excellent.

Figure 6 shows the effect of chloride concentration for buffers containing 95% ethanolamine and 5% Tris and a mixed-bed column containing 14% AG 4-X4 and 86% SOURCE 30Q. As seen in this figure, increasing the chloride concentration and, thus, the total buffer concentration, reduces the duration of the pH transition and results in a more linear pH gradient. The model is again in excellent agreement with the experimental result indicating that even though AG 4-X4 and SOURCE 30Q have very different mean particle sizes, particle size distributions, and particle shapes, the induced pH gradients conform closely to those expected for ideal conditions. The only substantial deviations are seen near the end of the pH transitions as the pH approaches the final value of 7. Likely, this area is unimportant for protein separation as long as the gradient conditions are appropriately selected so that elution occurs in the middle of the gradient.

Column length\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0cm. Symbols are experimental data and lines are model predictions.   Figure 7 shows the pH profile obtained for a column containing 14% AG 4-X4 and 86% SOURCE 30Q with a pH 9 to 7 step using buffers mixtures containing 93% ethanolamine and 7% BisTris and 15\u00a0mM chloride. As seen in this figure, the pH transition is initially fairly gradual as in the previously shown results. However, as the pH falls below about 7.8, the slope of the pH profile increases dramatically, dropping quickly to the final pH of 7. This behavior is due to the low pK  a  value of BisTris. When the pH is relatively high, BisTris (pK  a \u00a0=\u00a06.46 at 298\u00a0K) has essentially no buffering capacity and is completely deprotonated. However, as the pH decreases, its presence as a buffer becomes significant, substantially speeding up and sharpening the pH wave. The model also predicts this behavior. The analytical solution predicts initially a smooth profile. As the pH decreases, however, the characteristic velocity, calculated according to Eq. (12), eventually reaches a minimum, which is indicated by the rightmost point of the dashed line in the inset of Fig. 7. For these conditions, a shock wave, defined by a sharp transition between an intermediate chloride concentration and pH, catches up with the simple wave giving a composite transition consisting of a simple wave followed by a shock wave. The intermediate chloride concentration at which this shock occurs,  and the corresponding pH and shock velocity are readily found by equating simple wave and shock velocities (22), which yields: Mixed-Beds of Strong and Weak Anion Exchange Resins for Protein Separations with Step-Induced pH GradientsAll authorsTarl A.

Inset shows the region between 100 and 150\u00a0CV. The dashed line shows the simple wave profile calculated with eq. 16, which is unphysical as it predicts overlapping concentrations.     For the conditions of Fig. 7, Eq. (19) together with Eqs. (1\u20137) and Eq. (12) yields \u00a0mM, pH  shock \u00a0=\u00a07.617, and CV  shock \u00a0=\u00a0120.2. The experimental results are consistent with the self-sharpening trend expected for such a shock transition. However, although the trends are consistent with the analytical solution, as seen in Fig. 7, better quantitative agreement is seen with the numerical solution of the model equations using a finite number of discretization points. The results shown for N\u00a0=\u00a050, 80, and 200 are in nearly perfect agreement with the analytical solution at relatively high pH, where the model predicts a simple wave and the effects of axial dispersion are negligible. However, in the shock transition zone, whose sharpness is affected by dispersion, the numerical results vary with N. For these conditions, the best fit of the experimental results is obtained with N=80, which provides good agreement with the experimental profile throughout the entire range of pH values. Although not shown for brevity, the chloride concentration profile, obtained from the effluent conductivity for this experiment, was also in similar agreement with this model prediction. Unfortunately, since the ion exchange equilibrium is not linear for our conditions, N is not directly equivalent to the number of plates determined, for example, from an HETP test. Thus, a more complicated model, accounting explicitly for actual physical dispersion mechanisms is deemed necessary for a complete a priori prediction. Nevertheless it is apparent that, once N is determined empirically for a given column, our simple model can be used to predict the effects of varying operating conditions. From a practical viewpoint, the behavior seen in Fig. 7 could be used advantageously to create conditions where the initial shallow gradient separates a mixture of similar components, followed by a sharp drop in pH to strip late-eluting components from the column after the desired separation is complete. This would be analogous to a conventional strip step obtained by feeding multiple mobile phases at the column entrance, but with the added convenience that in this case the entire pH profile is the result of a single pH step at the column entrance. A final consideration is the effect of temperature on the induced pH gradients. As discussed in the Methods section of this paper, the pK  a  values of the amine buffers used vary linearly with temperature with slopes between \u22120.020 and \u22120.029\u00b0C\u22121. Figure 8 shows the predicted induced pH gradients for the conditions of Fig. 6 accounting for the effects of temperature on the buffers pK  a  values. As seen in this figure the effect of temperature on the induced pH gradient is significant suggesting that precise temperature control would be needed.

Separation of mAb Charge Variants In this section we provide two application examples of the mixed-bed concept to protein separation in order to address two independent issues: a. the ability to perform difficult protein separations, andb. the absence of any effects of protein load on the pH gradient.  Figure 9 demonstrates the separation of the deamidated mAb mixture described in the Materials section of this paper using a mixed-bed column containing 14% AG 4-X4 and 86% SOURCE 30Q for the conditions of Fig. 7 (300\u00a0cm/h, 20\u00a0cm column length) with a protein load of 2\u00a0mg per mL of packed bed volume. For this purpose, the protein, dissolved in the initial pH 9 buffer was quickly applied to the column which was then washed with 5 column volumes of the initial buffer before changing over stepwise to the pH 7 elution buffer. Fractions were collected at the column outlet based on the UV trace at 280\u00a0nm as shown by the vertical bars in this figure. These fractions were concentrated using ultrafiltration, and subjected to IEF analysis using Coomassie blue stain. Ten \u00b5g of total protein were loaded in each lane, except for fraction 4 for which the load was between 2 and 3\u00a0\u00b5g. As seen in Fig. 9, the deamidated mAb load contains three major and one minor band at pI values spanning from 8.2, which is the pI of the native mAb, to about 7.6. Although the UV trace shows multiple peaks, it is obvious that complete resolution was not attained. On the other hand, despite the relatively high mobile phase velocity (300\u00a0cm/h), fractions with substantial homogeneity were obtained as indicated by the presence of only one major band for each of the fractions 1\u20133. Fraction 4 appears to be more heterogeneous, probably containing a broad range of more highly deamidated species with lower pIs and hence greater retentivity on anion exchangers. The rapid drop in pH for longer time obtained with the addition of 7% BisTris to the buffer seems to do a good job stripping these variants in a relatively small volume. Based on the peak maxima and the pH trace, the elution pH values corresponding to peaks 1, 2, and 3 are approximately 7.9, 7.8, and 7.7, respectively. These values are somewhat lower than the corresponding estimated pI values determined by IEF (8.2, 8.0, and 7.8, respectively). This trend is consistent with the known behavior of chromatofocusing where proteins elute at pH lower than their pI on anion exchangers and at pH higher than their pI on cation exchangers (9, 11). It should be noted that in this proof-of-concept run no attempt was made to optimize the pH gradient to shorten its duration. Thus, elution occurred at relatively large CV-values. The effect of the induced pH gradient duration on resolution will be considered in a future communication.

The figure at the bottom shows the IEF analysis results for the fractions along with pI values based on standard proteins.   The second application example, shown in Fig. 10, illustrates the effect of protein loading on the induced pH gradient formed with a mixed-bed column containing 10% AG 4-X4 and 90% UNOsphere DQ. The non-deamidated mAb sample described in the Materials section was used for these experiments. Protein loads are given in this figure as mg of total protein per mL of packed bed volume. In each case, after loading the sample at pH 9 and washing with the load buffer, elution was obtained with a pH step from 9 to 7 using buffer mixtures containing 97% ethanolamine and 3% Tris with 15\u00a0mM chloride concentrations at 150\u00a0cm/hr. The results clearly confirm that the induced pH gradient was completely unaffected by the protein load and in good agreement with the prediction based on the analytical solution of the model equations, which is shown by the solid line. Thus, as predicted, pH gradient generation and protein binding were essentially decoupled through the use of the mixed-bed. Although IEF analyses were not conducted for these runs, the protein elution profiles shown in Fig. 10 also show that separation of deamidated impurities was likely obtained at least at the lower protein loads. Increasing protein load obviously resulted in increasingly skewed peaks with earlier eluting maximum. Considering that the maximum mAb binding capacity of this resin is on the order of only 80\u00a0mg/mL (based on equilibrium isotherm measurements not shown here), the peak shapes obtained are likely a result of increasing non-linearity of the protein adsorption isotherm as the amount protein loaded approached the resin's binding capacity.

CONCLUSIONS Induced pH gradients created by a step change in mobile phase pH using mixed-bed columns of weak and strong anion exchange resins have been shown to be adjustable by varying concentration and type of buffers used, to be reproducible, and, in most cases, to be accurately predictable using a local equilibrium model. The duration of the induced pH gradients is controlled by the concentration and composition of the mobile-phase buffer and the weak base ligand content of the column. Increasing the buffer concentration or decreasing the weak ligand content by changing the ratio of weak and strong resin components results in gradients with a shorter duration. The pK  a  values of both the weak base resin and the non-interacting buffers determine the gradient shape. Mixtures of different buffering species can thus be used to obtain different pH gradient shapes including segmented pH gradients with different slopes in different regions. The weak anion exchanger AG 4-X4 was used successfully in various mixtures with several different strong anion exchangers giving pH profiles that were independent of the particular strong anion exchanger used. Microscopic examination of embedded and stained columns show that this resin can be co-packed with several commercial strong anion exchangers resulting in a homogeneous distribution across column length and diameter. Although these experiments were limited to laboratory scale columns, it is likely that uniformly packed beds can also be obtained at the large scale provided that resins with reasonably well-matched particle sizes and density are used. As a practical application, the mixed-bed approach was demonstrated for the separation of the charge variants present in a deamidated mAb mixture. Although the separation was not optimized and was not complete, highly homogeneous fractions could be obtained with a pH gradient generated through a simple step change in buffer composition at the column entrance. Moreover, identical pH gradients could be obtained independent of protein load because pH gradient generation and protein binding occurred on separate phases in the mixed-bed column. As a practical tool for preparative separations, the mixed-bed approach has the advantage of simplicity and flexibility in that the same weak base resin can be used with multiple strong anion exchangers, each selected to optimize a particular separation. Compared to separations with pH gradients generated by applying a gradient at the entrance, separations with the mixed-bed columns presented in this work require only a step change in buffer. Thus, the gradient is not dialed in by programming a gradient pump, but is implemented through optimization of proper buffer compositions. This is also the case when our approach is compared with separations based on salt gradients. In order to obtain separations of protein charge variants with salt gradients at constant pH, very shallow salt gradients would likely be needed, which could be difficult to generate reliably in a GMP setting. The gradients generated with our approach can be easily predicted with sufficient accuracy either using a simple equilibrium model (if only smooth pH transitions are expected) or using a numerical model that takes into account axial dispersion empirically (via a finite difference discretization of the equations) if shock waves are expected. Some disadvantages also exist. One is that a fraction of the column volume is not available for protein binding, but this can be minimized by using a weak ion exchanger with high ligand density. Another is associated with the potential complexity of mixing and co-packing different resins in the same column. Thus the advantages noted above have to be balanced against these potential disadvantages. In practice, the former are more likely to outweigh the latter when the separation is especially difficult and high resolution is required. A final consideration is the predictability of protein elution and the effects of protein load on the separation. Since we have demonstrated that pH gradient generation and protein binding are effectively decoupled, it should be possible to predict these effects based on an experimental knowledge of protein chromatographic behavior on the strong resin component only, which will be presented in a future communication.

By continuously introducing the feed material to be separated at a stationary point at the top of the bed and eluent everywhere else around the annulus, elution chromatography occurs. The rotation rate of the sorbent bed causes the separated components to appear as helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point; hence, the separation process is truly continuous. The continuous separation of copper, nickel, and cobalt from an ammoniacal leach liquor has been used to evaluate the behavior and capabilitiesmore\u00a0\u00bb of a variety of continuous annular chromatographs (CACs). The experimental units ranged in diameter from 89 to 445 mm and in annulus width from 6 to 51 mm. The effects of feed rate, feed concentration, rotation rate, eluent and eluent velocity, and column size were experimentally determined and modeled to show how they affect the performance of a CAC system. Use of the described models should allow confident design of new CAC units for performing continuous separations on a preparative scale. With its capability for continuously separating many components using one or a number of eluents, the CAC should make chromatography a competitive process in many industrial applications. 21 tables, 105 figures.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplacement separations by continuous annular chromatography\n\nConference\nDeCarli, II, J; Carta, G; Byers, C\n\nContinuous annular chromatography (CAC) has been introduced as an effective means of carrying out chromatographic separations in a truly continuous manner. Process applications have been demonstrated. In this work the authors demonstrate how CAC can be operated for displacement development separations. In this mode of operation of the apparatus separation and concentration of multicomponent mixtures can be obtained simultaneously and continuously.

The chromatographic apparatus consists of a slowly rotating annular bed of sorbent material. The feed mixture which is to be separated is continuously introduced at a stationary point at the top of the bed, while eluent flows over the remainder of the annulus. The rotation of the sorbend bed coupled with the elution development induced by the downflow of eluent causes the feed components to appear as individual helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point. The separation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, usingmore\u00a0\u00bb the calcium form of a cation-exchange resin, was investigated using water as the eluent. Experiments were carried out both with a synthetic mixture of the sugars as well as with an industrial feedstock. The separation was explored first in a bench-scale conventional fixed-bed column and then in the pilot-scale continuous chromatography. Factors such as column loading, feed-to-eluent ratio, and feed concentration were investigated both experimentally an theoretically. The results of bench-sale experiments were carried out in the limit of infinite dilution, almost perfectly scaled to the pilot unit when loading was low and feed mixtures were of low viscosity. Very significant deviations from ideality were, however, observed at high feed loadings, when the feed viscosity exceeded that of the eluent by more than a factor of 2.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/bp00001a003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous separation of proteins by annular chromatography\n\nJournal Article\nBloomingburg, G; Bauer, J; Carta, G; ...  - Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)\n\nIn this paper, the separation of protein mixtures by continuous annular chromatography (CAC) is studied in a preparative-scale apparatus. S-Sepharose, a strong-acid porous cation-exchange resin is used as the separation medium, and mixtures of albumin, hemoglobin and cytochrome c are used as model separation system. Equilibrium and mass-transfer parameters are developed for this system on the basis of fixed-bed chromatograph experiments. A mathematical model is then successfully used in conjunction with these parameters to simulate the performance of the CAC separations. The continuous separation performance of the annular apparatus is found to be essentially the same as the batchwise performancemore\u00a0\u00bb of an equivalent conventional chromatograph, making the unit attractive for preparative and process-scale applications where continuous throughput is desirable.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/ie00053a031\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Similar Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Website Policies / Important Links\n Contact Us\n\nVulnerability Disclosure Program\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Both fragments were identified by MS as missing one of the two scFv domains and its flexible linker, but one of them also contains an additional C-terminal lysine. The separation of these fragments on both resins occurs as a result of differences in non-specific ligand-protein interactions that are modulated by the salt concentration. For the ProPac WCX-10 column, complex, multipeak elution behaviors are observed, since, as a result of the linker flexibility, both the intact molecule and the fragments appear to exist in multiple binding configurations with each scFv domains either collapsed onto the IgG framework or extended away from it. With a residence time of 2.5 min and at 21 \u00b0C, two peak elution is observed for the fragments which contain a single linked scFv and three peak elution for the intact molecule which contains two linked scFvs. This behavior is affected by residence time, temperature, and hold time. Increasing the residence time to 25 min or increasing temperature to 40\u00b0C results in elution of a single, merged peak for each of the protein species. For Nuvia HR-S, the broader peaks, obtained as a result of mass transfer limitations, tend to obscure the multipeak elution behavior. Nevertheless, even for this resin, the effects of configurational flexibility are still manifested at the single-particle scale and affect the evolution of the patterns of protein binding within individual resin particles as evident from confocal microscopy observations.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsBispecific bivalent antibodiesAntibody fragment purificationMultiple peak elutionConfigurational flexibilityMulticomponent adsorption kineticsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

By applying a coordinate transformation, the model is solved analytically using the Laplace transform approach. The moment generating property of the Laplace domain solution is used to derive analytical expressions for the first three moments of the response to rectangular injections. These moments are instructive for analyzing the retention time, band broadening and asymmetry of elution profiles. Compared to isocratic elution, the derivation of analytical solutions and moments for gradient elution is more complicated, because the retention behavior of the solutes depends on the varying mobile phase modulator. Several case studies are evaluated theoretically. To gain confidence on the derived analytical results, a high-resolution finite volume scheme is also applied to solve the same model equations numerically. The analytical solutions and moments provided are utilized to predict the effects of starting and ending times of gradient, magnitude of modulator concentration variation, gradient slopes, and mass transfer coefficient on retention and peak shape. The analytical moment expressions derived can be used to determine retention and mass transfer parameters from experimental peaks and to predict elution behaviors if these parameters are known.Graphical abstractDownload : Download high-res image (115KB)Download : Download full-size imageNavigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsLiquid chromatographyGradient elutionTransport modelCoordinate transformationAnalytical solutionsMoment analysisRecommended articlesCited by (0)\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The binding capacity and selectivity are dependent on the CHT type and salt concentration. While the rate of protein adsorption on CHT Type I is slow and controlled largely by pore diffusion resulting in relatively poor separation, adsorption on CHT Type II is much faster and better separation is obtained than with Type I. However, comparison with predictions based on pore diffusion alone, reveals the presence of additional resistances associated with adsorption and displacement kinetics. A spreading kinetics model assuming multiple binding configurations coupled with pore diffusion was developed to describe these effects and found to be in quantitative agreement with the frontal analysis results and able to predict the separation achieved for conditions outside the range of the experiments. To help validate the assumed mechanism, isocratic elution experiments were also conducted at low protein loads. The chromatograms could be described by the solution of the spreading model coupled with pore diffusion in the linear region of the isotherm with parameters determined from the analytical expressions for the peak moments. This confirms that there is an increasing tendency to spread with slower kinetics as the salt concentration is decreased and binding strength is increased.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsHydroxyapatiteFrontal analysisAntibodiesMonomer/dimer separationsModelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report on robustness and selectivity benefits for Repligen CaptivA PriMAB resin with ligands modified with 5.2\u202fkDa and 21.5\u202fkDa PEG chains, respectively. PEGylation of ProA ligands allowed the resin to retain a higher percentage of static binding capacity relative to the unmodified resin upon digestion with chymotrypsin, a representative serine protease. The level of protection against digestion was independent of the PEG molecular weight or modification extent for the PEGylation chemistry used. Additionally, PEGylation of the ligands was found to decrease the level of non-specific binding of fluorescently labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) aggregates to the surface of the resin particles as visualized via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The level of aggregate binding decreased as the PEG molecular weight increased, but increasing the extent of modification with 5.2\u202fkDa PEG chains had no effect. Further examination of resin particles via CLSM confirmed that the PEG chains on the modified ligands were capable of blocking the \u201chitchhiking\u201d association of BSA, a mock contaminant, to an adsorbed mAb that is prone to BSA binding. Ligands modified with 21.5\u202fkDa PEG chains were effective at blocking the association, while ligands modified with 5.2\u202fkDa PEG chains were not. Finally, ligands with 21.5\u202fkDa PEG chains increased the selectivity of the resin against host cell proteins (HCPs) produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by up to 37% during purification of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) from harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF) using a standard ProA chromatography protocol. The combined work suggests that PEGylating ProA chromatography media is a viable pathway for increasing both resin lifetime and host cell impurity clearance in downstream bioprocessing.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsProtein APEGylationAntibodiesSelectivityImpuritiesStabilityRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using amine buffers, the weak base resin generates smooth pH gradients when the column is subjected to pH steps, while the strong base resin interacts with the proteins effecting the separation. The model describes simultaneously ion exchange interaction on the weak base resin and protein adsorption and transport on the strong base resin. The separation of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) from a charge variant whose pI is about 0.2 pH units lower is studied experimentally with the anion exchange resins AG 4-X4 and SOURCE 30Q as the weak and strong base components, respectively. The properties of each resin are characterized independently and model parameters are obtained experimentally for each. Model predictions of pH gradient-based separations in columns containing different proportions of the two resins and at different buffer concentrations are found to be in agreement with experimental results. The model can thus be used as a process design tool to predict combinations of buffer and mixed-bed compositions, column lengths, and mobile phase velocities that would yield a desired separation performance.Keywords: induced pH gradientsanion exchangemonoclonal antibodiescharge variants\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTIONThe separation of protein charge variants resulting from post-translational modifications is industrially important in the production of many biopharmaceuticals since such charge variants can exhibit diminished pharmacological potency and/or stability compared to the native form (1). Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used for these separations as the strength of electrostatic interaction often varies for different variants. However, because of their similar molecular properties, these separations often require operation with either salt or pH gradients. In principle, pH gradients can be advantageous, since they can provide improved selectivity over salt gradients while allowing separation at low ionic strengths (2\u20134). In industrial practice, however, despite their advantages, pH gradients are seldom used, because of difficulties in reproducibly generating and controlling them at manufacturing scale.Gradients in pH can be generated externally or can be induced within the column. Externally generated pH gradients are created by varying the pH of the mobile phase upstream of the column entrance. This is often achieved through the use of programmed in-line mixing to continuously vary the ratio of two buffer solutions. When applied to a strong ion exchanger, in the absence of interactions between buffer components and the stationary phase, the ensuing pH wave travels through the column at the velocity of the mobile phase. Induced pH gradients, on the other hand, can be generated within the column with a step change in pH applied at the column entrance either using retained buffering species, such as the ampholytes used in chromatofocusing (5\u20137), or with unretained buffering species using a weak ion exchanger as the stationary phase. Under certain conditions, although a step change is applied at the column entrance, a smooth, reproducible pH gradient can be formed within the column. Since these gradients travel at a rate slower than the mobile phase velocity, individual species are focused at specific pH values along the traveling wave (8,9).Compared to operation with ampholytes, using a weak ion exchanger with unretained buffers is generally simpler and results in a process that is easier to predict. In this case, the pH gradients can be predicted solely based on the deprotonation constant and concentration of the weak base ligands and on the pKa values of the buffering species in the mobile phase (8\u201312). The former determine the pH range over which a smooth gradient can be induced and its overall duration, while the latter determine the shape of the pH gradient. Although several authors have already demonstrated empirically the resolution of protein mixtures using unretained buffers with either weak anion or weak cation exchangers (13\u201316), several drawbacks exist. The first is that protein retention is generally difficult to predict because the charge of the weak ligands changes as the pH varies. The second is that since the weak ion exchange ligands become uncharged at extreme pH values, unpredictable hydrophobic interactions can come into play altering selectivity and potentially affecting biomolecular properties. Finally, since the ligands responsible for the generation of the pH gradient are also responsible for protein binding, distortions in the pH profile can occur at the high protein loads that are typical of industrial chromatography. Even though in a polishing step, where the goal is to obtain resolution of hard-to-remove impurities, the protein load averaged over the entire column volume is likely to be relatively low, the local adsorbed protein concentration can still be close to saturation thereby affecting the local pH profile if a single resin is used.In our previous work (17), we have shown that some of these drawbacks can be overcome by using a mixed-bed column containing a small-pore weak ion exchanger packed together with a large-pore strong ion exchanger. In this approach, the small pores in the weak ion exchanger allow access only to small ions, thereby controlling pH, but prevent proteins from entering the resin beads and thus interacting with the weak ligands. The large pores of the strong ion exchanger provide access to proteins allowing their separation through selective interaction with its strong ligands, without affecting the internally generated pH gradient. As shown in our prior work (17), because the pH gradient generation and protein binding are effectively decoupled, the impact of protein load on the induced pH gradient is minimized and the pH gradient can be predicted accurately based on the behavior of the weak ion exchanger alone. Design flexibility is also improved as a single weak ion exchanger can be paired with different strong ion exchangers selected for different separation applications to optimize protein loading capacity, mass transfer, selectivity, and, ultimately, resolution. A particular advantage of the mixed-bed approach is that modeling and prediction of resolution are simplified. Weak and strong ion exchangers can be tested independently, the former for their ability to generate pH gradients and the latter for their ability to resolve protein mixtures at constant pH. The prediction of resolution in a mixed-bed with varying pH is thus theoretically possible by combining the independent predictions of the effects of the two resins through a suitable model.This work has thus three major goals. The first is to develop a model to predict resolution obtained with pH gradients in mixed bed columns based on the independent determination of the ion-exchange properties of the weak base resin and of the chromatographic properties of the strong base resin. The second is to compare model predictions with experimental results obtained for the separation of the charge variants of a monoclonal antibody. The third is to demonstrate how the model can be used to select conditions that yield the desired resolution by \u201ctuning\u201d the parameters that determine the induced pH gradient.THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTPrediction of Induced pH Gradients in Mixed-Bed ColumnsThe model used to predict the induced pH gradients for a column containing a mixture of weak and strong anion exchangers was developed in our prior work (17). Thus, only a brief summary is provided here. With reference to a mobile phase containing one or more amine buffering species and chloride as the only counterion, the model assumes that: (a) the two ion exchangers are uniformly distributed throughout the column; (b) the buffering species do not interact with either the weak or the strong anion exchanger; (c) exchange of chloride and hydroxide ions occurs only on the weak anion exchange ligands while the strong anion exchange ligands remain in the chloride form; and (d) the mass transfer rate for ions is high so that local equilibrium is maintained between the stationary and mobile phases. The first assumption is corroborated by experiments reported in reference (17), where embedding mixed-bed columns of the type used in this work in a resin, sectioning, and imaging the different particles showed that there was a random distribution across both column length and diameter. The second assumption is justified by the fact that the buffering species considered here are positively charged or neutral. The third assumption stems from the fact that the pKa of strong anion exchange ligands (e.g., quaternary ammonium ion) are very large (pKa >12) and that chloride ion is always in large excess compared to hydroxide at the pH values considered in this work. The last assumption stems from the relatively large diffusivity of the small ions (order of 10\u22125 cm2/s). Based on these assumptions, the four components of the model are as follows: Buffer Species Deprotonation Equilibria (1) Solution Electroneutrality (2) Chloride-Hydroxide Exchange Equilibrium (3) Material Balances for the Column (4)  (5) In these equations,  and  are the protonated and total concentrations of amine i, respectively,  is the corresponding deprotonation equilibrium constant, KW is the ionic product of water,  the concentration of weak base ligands in the weak anion exchanger, is the corresponding deprotonation constant, u, x, and t are mobile phase superficial velocity, column length coordinate, and time, respectively, and  is the total column porosity. The first term in this expression for  accounts for retention in the extraparticle void fraction, , while the second accounts for retention in the intraparticle pores, characterized by the porosities  and  of the weak and strong ion exchangers respectively, with  equal to the volume fraction of the weak anion exchanger in the mixed-bed. Note that q-values appearing in these equations are expressed per unit of solid resin volume of the weak base resin, thus excluding any contribution due to retention in the intraparticle void space.As shown in reference (17), two different methods can be used to solve these equations, the method of characteristics and a numerical algorithm. The former is semi-analytical and provides the limiting case when there is no axial dispersion. The latter accounts for non-idealities through the numerical dispersion introduced by a finite difference discretization scheme. Similar results were obtained with the two methods for conditions under which smooth pH gradients were obtained. The effect of dispersion was significant only for conditions where abrupt transitions (shock waves) were predicted in the pH gradients. The resin properties needed to make these calculations (= 0.44, = 0.63, = 3.45 mol/L resin solid, and = -log KR,w = 9.75) were obtained in our previous work (17). The amine buffer pKa-values and their temperature dependences were obtained from Beynon and Easterby (18).Prediction of Protein Retention and Band Broadening in Mixed-Bed ColumnsPredicting protein retention in mixed-bed columns requires a description of protein adsorption equilibrium and kinetics in the strong ion exchanger component of the mixed-bed as a function of both pH and buffer composition. The approach used in our work to describe protein adsorption equilibrium is based on the stoichiometric displacement model, which regards protein binding as the result of the following ion exchange process (19\u201321): (6)  where zi is the protein effective binding charge, equal to the number of chloride counterions exchanged. Protein binding to the weak anion exchanger is neglected based on the assumption that its pores are sufficiently small to exclude protein molecules and that the external surface area of the particles is insignificant. Limiting our analysis to the linear isotherm case, which is obtained at low protein loads, protein binding to the strong anion exchanger is thus described by the following equation (18\u201320): (7)  where  is the equilibrium constant for the protein-chloride exchange and  is the concentration of charged ligands. While  is theoretically constant for a strong ion exchanger, both  and zi can vary with pH as the protonation of the charged residues on the protein varies. Additionally, these parameters can also depend on the type and concentration of the buffer (19, 22, 23). Thus an empirical determination of their values is generally needed.With regards to adsorption kinetics, diffusional mass transfer in the pores of the strong ion exchanger is expected to be dominant when the reduced velocity at which the process is operated exceeds about 100 (24). Although pore diffusion could be modeled rigorously by taking into account concentration gradients within the particles, a simpler formulation based on the linear driving force (LDF) model (25) has been adopted in this work. Accordingly, mass transfer of each protein in the strong anion exchanger is described by the following equation: (8)  where  is the average protein concentration in the particle, De,i is the protein effective pore diffusivity, dp is the particle diameter, and  is the protein concentration in equilibrium with . KD,i is the partition coefficient for unbound protein molecules between the mobile phase and the liquid contained within the pores. Based on Eq. (7), we have: (9) The final component of the model is the following mass balance for each protein in the column: (10) Note that axial dispersion is neglected in this equation under the assumption that band-broadening is controlled by the rate of mass transfer in the strong ion exchanger. Equations (7)-(10), written for each protein, are coupled to the equations describing ion interactions with the weak ion exchanger, Eqs. (1)-(5), and solved simultaneously to predict protein retention and band broadening in the mixed-bed column. A numerical solution was obtained by discretizing the spatial derivatives by backwards finite differences and solving the resulting system of ordinary differential equations by Gear\u2019s method using subroutine DVIPAG in the IMSL\u00ae Numerical Libraries (Rogue Wave Software, Boulder, CO, USA). The number of discretization points used for the calculations was 100 as in our previous work (17). This value was sufficiently large that numerical dispersion had no apparent effect on either the predicted pH gradient, which was controlled by the gradual wave behavior described by Eqs. (1)-(5), or on protein band broadening in the pH gradient runs, which was controlled by the mass transfer effects described by Eq. (8).EXPERIMENTALMaterialsThe resins used in this work are AG 4-X4 from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA) and SOURCE 30Q from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Their basic properties are summarized in Table 1. AG 4-X4 is a weak anion exchanger with trimethylamine functional groups, has a 1.4 kDa size exclusion limit, and is comprised of irregular particles, 50\u2013200 \u03bcm in size. SOURCE 30Q is a strong anion exchanger based on a poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) matrix, and has large pores, a high size exclusion limit, and a narrow particle size distribution with an average diameter of 28 \u03bcm (17). Predicting Retention and Resolution of Protein Charge Variants in Mixed-Beds of Strong and Weak Anion Exchange Resins with Step-Induced pH GradientsAll authorsTarl A. Vetter, Gisela Ferreira, David Robbins & Giorgio Cartahttps://doi.org/10.1080/01496395.2014.907810Published online:12 August 2014TABLE 1  Resin propertiesDisplay TableChemicals used in buffer preparation were of ACS grade and were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IgG1, Mr \u02dc 150 kDa, pI \u02dc 8.2) was provided by MedImmune (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The mAb sample was essentially 100% monomer based on size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA). In separate experiments, the mAb was found to contain a major acidic variant with pI \u02dc 8.0 accounting for about 20% of the total protein plus additional minor, more acidic variants with pI around 7.8 accounting for another 5% of the total. These variants could be distinguished by isoelectric focusing with precast IsoGel\u00ae Agarose IEF plates (pH 7-11) from Lonza, Inc. (Allandale, NJ, USA) as described in reference (17) and quantified by HPLC with a ProPac WCX-10 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) pellicular cation exchange column at pH 6.75 as described in reference (26). While only minimal resolution was obtained by salt gradient anion exchange chromatography using SOURCE 30Q alone, as shown below, good resolution was obtained using a mixed-bed of AG 4-X4 and SOURCE 30Q with an induced pH gradient. In this case, two distinct peaks were observed, one containing the native mAb and the other the more strongly retained major acidic variant. Two separate samples with 90% purity of the native mAb and with 70% purity of the major acidic variant, respectively, were obtained by pooling fractions collected from several runs, concentrated to 1 g/L by ultrafiltration with a 30 kDa MWCO membrane, and refrigerated. These samples were used to independently characterize the chromatographic behavior of the native mAb and of the major acidic variant on SOURCE 30Q. The purity of these samples was adequate to determine retention properties from gradient elution experiments, as it was possible to accurately determine the chloride concentration at elution from the peak maximum.Buffers containing ethanolamine (pKa = 9.50 at 25\u00b0C (18)) or Tris (pKa = 8.06 at 25\u00b0C (18)) and buffers containing mixtures of the two were prepared by adding the amine species in free-base form to HCl solutions of known concentration in the amounts needed to obtain the desired pH. All experiments were conducted at room temperature, 24 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. Since temperature affects the pKa of the amine buffers used, the temperature was carefully monitored. The pH measurements were made with a Fisher Scientific Accumet combination electrode (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).MethodsResin Charge DensityThe weak base content of AG 4-X4 as given in Table 1 was determined in our prior work (17). The charge density of SOURCE 30Q, also reported in Table 1, was determined by packing a resin sample in a 5 x 50 mm Tricorn column from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA), equilibrating it with a 15 mM Tris-HCl solution at pH 8, and applying a step-change to a 15 mM Tris-benzoate solution also at pH 8. An \u00c4KTA Explorer 10 unit (also from GE Healthcare) was used for these experiments at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Benzoic acid, with a pKa of 4.2 (18), is negatively charged at pH 8 and displaces the chloride ions initially present in the resin. A sharp breakthrough of benzoate ion is thus obtained, which can be monitored by UV at 280 nm. Integration of the area above the resultant curve is then used to determine the resin charge density by material balance. The resulting value was 0.427 mol/L of resin solid, which corresponds, approximately, to 100 \u03bcmol/mL of packed bed based on the extraparticle and intraparticle porosities of 0.35 and 0.63, respectively. It should be noted that this value is to be regarded as an upper limit since we cannot completely exclude the possibility that non-electrostatic interactions contributed, to some extent, to retention of the benzoate front.Protein Adsorption Equilibrium and Rate ParametersThe parameters describing protein retention on SOURCE 30Q were obtained from linear gradient elution (LGE) experiments at different pH values. These experiments were conducted with the SOURCE 30Q resin packed in a 5 x 50 mm Tricorn column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) with 0.1 mg injections of the mAb. After washing with 5 CV of the running buffer (10 mM ethanolamine-HCl) the column was eluted with linear gradients from 10 mM ethanolamine-HCl to 150 mM ethanolamine-HCl with varying slopes at different pH values. LGE experiments were also conducted with mobile phases containing Tris-HCl alone and 10 mM ethanolamine-HCl with NaCl. LGE results were analyzed by the method of Yamamoto and co-workers (27\u201329) as discussed below.The mAb effective pore diffusivity in SOURCE 30Q was determined from a van Deemter curve obtained for non-binding conditions. For this purpose 20 \u03bcL injections of the mAb dissolved in 10 mM ethanolamine-HCl at pH 9 containing 1 M NaCl were made to the SOURCE 30Q column described above and eluted isocratically at mobile phase superficial velocities from 75 to 1200 cm/h. The first and second central moments of the ensuing peaks were calculated numerically and the HETP calculated accordingly including corrections for the extra-column void volume and dispersion.Mixed-Bed pH Gradient Based SeparationsMixed-beds of AG 4-X4 and SOURCE 30Q were prepared by mixing the two resins in specified volumetric proportions and packing the mixture as described in reference (17) in a 5 x 200 mm Tricorn column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) with a bed height of 20.0 \u00b1 0.2 cm. After equilibration with the initial buffer (pH between 8.9 and 9.0), samples containing 1 to 11 mg of the crude protein dissolved in the initial buffer were applied to the column, followed by a 5 CV wash step with the same buffer. The mobile phase was then stepped to a pH 7 solution with the same chloride concentration (12.5 to 50 mM) as the initial buffer. Elution was monitored using the UV, conductivity, and pH detectors of the \u00c4KTA Explorer 10 unit. Fractions of the column effluent were also collected and analyzed off-line for more precise determination of pH. Protein concentrations were calculated from the UV detector data using the known extinction coefficient according to Lambert-Beer\u2019s law. The mobile phase velocity for these experiments was 300 cm/h.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONProtein Retention as a Function of pH and Mobile Phase CompositionLGE experiments were conducted with the SOURCE 30Q column at pH values between 7.75 and 9.00 in 0.25 pH increments. Figure 1 shows representative results for native mAb and the major acidic variant at pH 8.0 with ethanolamine-HCl gradients (Figs. 1a and 1c) and with NaCl gradients (Fig. 1c), all with identical gradient slopes based on the chloride concentration. Figure 1a also gives two representative LGE results for the native mAb with a Tris-HCl gradient. In each case elution occurred at lower chloride concentration as the gradient length was increased. It is also apparent that the chloride concentration at elution was dependent on the buffer species. While ethanolamine and Tris gave nearly identical results, NaCl gave very different retention with higher chloride concentration needed for elution compared to the amine buffers. The reason for the differences between NaCl and the amine-HCl eluents is not known, but it may be due to association of the amine species with the protein, which, in turn, could result in weaker binding.

Based on Eq. (7),  can be written as follows: (13)  where   and (14) In Eq. (13), the first term on the right hand side describes protein partitioning into the resin macropores while the second describes protein binding. Combining Eqs. (12) and (13) yields: (15) Thus, zi and Ai can be obtained by conducting LGE experiments with different normalized gradient slopes, recording the chloride concentration at which the protein elutes, and comparing the results with Eq. (15). The retention factors  = 0.803 and = 1.11 were obtained from pulse injection experiments with, respectively, the protein and chloride modifier under non-binding conditions. Integration of Eq. (15) was performed using the trapezoidal rule to determine the best-fit values of zi and Ai. For this purpose, different values of z were tried in 0.01 increments and for each zi the value of Ai that minimized the sum of error squares was determined using the Solver function in Excel. Figure 2 shows the results ( vs.  on log-log scales) comparing the experimental data for the native mAb (closed symbols) and major acidic variant (open symbols) with lines calculated from Eq. (15) with the best-fit values of zi and Ai. Note that these lines are not straight (as would be predicted from Eq. (15) for cases where  =  (28\u201330)), although the deviation from linearity on these scales is relatively small. As seen in the figure their slope decreases as the pH decreases indicating that the effective binding charges decrease for both species as the pH is lowered.

Open symbols and dashed lines are for the major acidic variant.The retention factor calculated using the best-fit zi and Ai values for the native mAb (solid lines) and major acidic variant (dashed lines) are shown in Fig. 3. For both species, retention increases with pH as the protein negative charge increases. However, even at or below the protein pI (\u02dc8.2), there is still significant retention. For these conditions, the net protein charge is low or even positive suggesting that protein-surface interactions are likely the result of clustered negatively charged residues that interact favorably with the quaternary ammonium ion ligands in the SOURCE 30Q resin. Another possibility is that non-electrostatic interactions (e.g., hydrophobic) contribute to protein binding. However, this possibility seems unlikely for our conditions, as batch isotherm experiments (not shown in this work for brevity) indicated little or no mAb binding at pH values near or below the pI when the chloride concentration was higher than 50 to100 mM. At all pH values investigated the major acidic variant was more strongly retained than the native mAb, consistent with its lower pI compared to the native mAb and, hence, greater negative charge at a given pH. The spread between curves for the two species also decreases as the pH increases up to pH 8.75 increasing only slightly as the pH is increased further to 9. Better selectivity is obviously obtained near or below the isolectric points, when binding occurs only at very low chloride concentrations.

As seen in this figure over the pH range investigated, zi increases linearly with pH for both native mAb and major acidic variant and is consistently higher by about 0.5 units for the latter. The regressed lines are and , for the native mAb and variant, respectively. A has the opposite trend, decreasing sharply with increasing pH. Since A is theoretically related to z through Eq. (14), Ke and can be determined by fitting this equation to the A-data using the regressed linear relationship describing z as a function of pH. Values of Ke = 0.226 and 0.168 are obtained in this manner for the native mAb and major acidic variant, respectively, with = 0.160 mol/L resin solid. The latter value is much smaller than the independently determined resin charge density (Table 1), suggesting that only a fraction of the ligands present in SOURCE 30Q can actually interact with the mAb.

Since there is no significant difference in molecular size and no resolution between species under these conditions, the crude mAb mixture was used for these experiments. The results are shown in Fig. 5a; the peak broadens and becomes more skewed as the mobile phase velocity increases indicating that kinetic effects are dominant. The first moment calculated from these peaks is 0.65 \u00b1 0.04 CV. Since = 0.36 for this column, this value yields  = 0.803 or KD = 0.71, indicating that the mAb molecules can access a large fraction of the total intraparticle porosity ( = 0.63). Figure 5b shows the corresponding reduced HETP (h = HETP/dp) as a function of reduced velocity, , where dp is the particle diameter and D0 the free solution diffusivity of the mAb (D0 = 5.0 x 10\u22127 cm2/s (31)).

The corresponding ratio = 0.14 is typical for macroporous resins such as SOURCE 30Q (24). Protein mass transfer for the weak anion exchanger is neglected as the protein is completely excluded from its pores and the external particle surface area is very small.Separations with Induced pH GradientsTwo different AG 4-X4/SOURCE 30Q mixed-bed columns both with a length of approximately 20 cm but containing 10 and 14% AG 4-X4, respectively, were used for these experiments. In both cases, buffers containing 95% ethanolamine and 5% Tris with different chloride concentrations, prepared as discussed in the \u201cMaterials\u201d section, were used with a pH step from 9.0 \u00b1 0.1 to 7.0. These buffers were shown in our previous work (17) to yield smooth pH gradients with reasonable durations. Note that in this range the pH gradient results are not very sensitive to the initial pH. Figure 6 shows the experimental results for the 14% AG 4-X4 column with buffers containing different chloride concentrations. In each case, following the pH step change at 0 CV, the pH decreases smoothly. As shown in our prior work (17), the conductivity of the column effluent remains fairly constant throughout each of these runs (data not shown here). With 50 mM chloride (Fig. 6a), the induced pH gradient is almost linear and has a shorter duration. However, there is no visible resolution of the charge variants. The induced pH gradient duration becomes longer as the chloride concentration is reduced (Figs. 6b and 6c), and some resolution of the major acidic variant becomes evident. Finally, with 15 mM chloride (Fig. 6d), the induced pH gradient is very shallow leading to two distinct elution peaks. IEF analyses of fractions collected for the 15 mM chloride run near the maxima of the two protein peaks, conducted as described in reference (17), are shown in Fig. 7. These results confirm that substantial resolution of late eluting charge variants was obtained for these conditions. The first peak contains pure native mAb (pI\u02dc8.2), the second the major acidic variant (pI\u02dc8.0), and the tailing portion a mixture of a few lower pI species. For all four runs, model predictions based on parameters determined independently (Fig. 6) are in reasonable agreement with the experimental profiles, although there are some deviations between predicted and experimental retention volumes. These deviations are likely due in large part to small differences between predicted and experimental pH values. Since pH has a very strong effect on protein retention, small differences in pH can result in fairly large differences in retention volumes. Additionally, there could be inaccuracies in the model parameters that lead to slightly over-predicting retention when elution occurs at relatively high pH values (e.g., Fig. 6a) and to slightly under-predict it when elution occurs at lower pH values. In practice, the model parameters could be adjusted empirically to fit the experimental behavior better than the predictions shown in this paper, which are based entirely on independent experimental measurements. Figure 8 shows the pH at which elution occurs as a function of chloride concentration, based on the data in Fig. 6 (and those from additional runs not shown in Fig. 6). The apparent variability in elution pH occurs in large part because of inaccuracies in measuring pH, whose repeatability was generally \u00b1 0.05 pH units. As seen in this figure, resolution occurs over a small range of pH values, thus requiring very shallow pH gradients. At higher chloride concentrations, the induced pH gradient becomes steeper and the pH at which elution occurs also increases, while the difference in elution pH between native mAb and major acidic variant narrows. This behavior, which is predicted well by the model, is different from that obtained for salt gradients at constant pH. In our case, elution occurs earlier in the gradient (i.e., at higher pH) with steeper pH gradients, while with salt gradient elution, elution occurs later in the gradient (i.e., at higher salt concentrations) with steeper salt gradients.

The eluted peak profile shows again two distinct peaks followed by a tailing portion. As in the previous case, model predictions based on parameters determined independently are in agreement with the experimental profiles, demonstrating the ability of the model to predict both the induced pH gradient, and the protein retention and peak widths over relatively broad ranges of conditions. The current model accounts only for the native mAb and the major acidic variant which elutes closest to the native mAb, and disregards more acidic minor variants. Thus, it does not predict the behavior of those lower pI variants that elute much later resulting in extensive tailing. In practice, however, this may not be important, as the main practical problem would be to separate the most closely eluting species.Predicting Retention and Resolution of Protein Charge Variants in Mixed-Beds of Strong and Weak Anion Exchange Resins with Step-Induced pH GradientsAll authorsTarl A.

The column comprises a weak base resin with small pores inaccessible to proteins and a strong base resin into which protein can diffuse and adsorb. The former generates smooth pH gradients through interactions of the buffer component with the weak base ligands, while the latter performs the separation as a result of specific electrostatic interactions between the protein molecules and its strong-base ligands. The model merges two components\u2014one that predicts the pH gradient based on a description of ion-exchange equilibrium in the weak base resin, and one that describes protein adsorption on the strong base resin as a function of pH and counterion concentration. Band broadening is negligible for the small ions that are responsible for generating the pH gradient, but is described for the protein on the strong base resin using a linear driving force approximation. A procedure is outlined to independently determine the model parameters for the separate components of the mixed-bed system, and then use these parameters to predict the behavior of the mixed system. As shown in our prior work (17), the parameters needed to describe the generation of pH gradients are obtained from a potentiometric titration of the weak anion exchanger. Those needed to describe protein adsorption equilibrium and kinetics for the strong anion exchanger are obtained from linear gradient elution experiments at constant pH and from pulse injections under non-binding conditions. The ability of the model to predict resolution in mixed-bed columns is demonstrated for the separation of a native mAb from an acidic variant with slightly lower pI using the resin AG 4-X4 as the weak anion exchanger and SOURCE 30Q as the strong one. The stoichiometric displacement model was found to provide a good description of the relationship between protein retention and chloride ion concentration, while an empirical linear relationship was found to describe the effect of pH on the protein effective binding charge. Diffusional transport of the mAb in the pores of the strong base resin was found to be rate limiting. Using the parameters as determined independently for the two resins, the model was found to fairly accurately predict protein elution pH, retention, and resolution in mixed-bed columns containing differing percentages of weak base resin, operated at differing mobile phase compositions.From a practical viewpoint, it is clear that the difficult separation of mAb charge variants (and likely other proteins) can be conveniently conducted in a predictable manner with pH gradients generated in mixed-bed columns in response to a pH step. The mixed-bed approach allows one to characterize each resin component separately. The model presented in this work allows one to predict their combined behavior providing the means for rational selection and model-driven optimization of combinations of mobile phase composition and mixed-bed composition to yield the desired separation performance. Since column length and flow rate appear explicitly in the model, their effects can also be estimated from model calculations. The model does have some weaknesses especially with regards to predicting the pH profiles at the higher pH values. In general, the model over-predicted pH in the initial part of the gradient. The reasons for this behavior are not known, but we observed that the prediction could not be improved by simply changing the current model parameters, indicating that a different description of the chloride-hydroxide exchange on the weak base resin at the higher pH values may be needed to improve accuracy. It should also be noted that predicting protein retention in our experiments is inherently difficult as protein interactions with the stationary phase are extremely sensitive to pH especially near the protein pI, which is likely to have caused some of the observed discrepancies in elution pH. Another consideration is the effect of protein loading on resolutions. We have already demonstrated (17), that protein loading does not affect the pH gradient in our mixed-bed system. However, overloaded conditions are likely to reduce resolution as a result of non-linear and competitive binding. These effects will be examined in a future communication. A final consideration is whether it is possible to obtain a uniform distribution of the two resins in large-scale columns. As discussed in our prior work (17), this possibility has to be addressed experimentally. Although in our columns the different resin sizes and densities did not cause problems, packing large-scale columns uniformly may require using resins with similar size and density.NOMENCLATURE Aiadsorption equilibrium parameter for protein i defined by Eq.

Two mathematical models are developed to predict the behavior of SMB reactors. The first one is based on a direct simulation of the transient behavior of each adsorptive reactor and the second is based on an equivalent true countercurrent analysis. The results of simulations based on these models suggest that the SMB concept can be applied to obtain an excellent approximation of true countercurrent chromatographic reactors without the complexities of countercurrent flow of solid and fluid phases.KeywordsEffluent ConcentrationBiochemical ConversionCountercurrent FlowSimultaneous SeparationPeriodic SwitchingThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

The mAb adsorption kinetics is controlled by pore diffusion and conforms to the classical shrinking core model. While the mAb adsorption rate increases with temperature, the ratio of effective and free solution diffusivity, De /D0, remains constant and has a value of 0.20. The BiSAb's structure is comprised of scFv domains that are genetically fused to a framework IgG through flexible peptide linkers which results in conformational flexibility leading to multiple binding forms with varying affinity for the adsorbent surface. As a result, adsorption of the BiSAbs shows complex patterns of total bound protein within the particles. These BiSAb adsorption patterns are influenced by buffer ionic strength, pH, and temperature in unique ways. Sharper intraparticle profiles are observed for conditions where the binding strength is greater (lower buffer concentration and/or pH) or when the protein is chemically crosslinked to restrict configurational flexibility. Temperature affects the BiSAb pore diffusivity as well as the interconversion kinetics. While the effects of temperature on BiSAb transport are also described by a constant De /D0\u00a0=\u00a00.15, the temperature also affects the rate of interconversion between binding forms leading to faster equilibration at higher temperatures. A phenomenological model indicates that the interplay of pore diffusion and adsorption with the kinetically limited interconversion between binding forms is responsible for the experimental trends.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsBispecific bivalent antibodiesConformational interconversionMass transfer modelingConfocal microscopyIon exchangeRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current affiliation: GlaxoSmithKline, King of Prussia, PA, USA.View Abstract\u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this work we simulate intraparticle adsorption profiles during batch adsorption assuming typical process conditions for pore, solid and parallel diffusion. Artificial confocal laser scanning microscopy images are created to identify apparent differences between the different transport mechanisms. Typical sharp fronts for pore diffusion are characteristic for Langmuir equilibrium constants of KL \u22651. Only at KL\u00a0=\u00a00.1 and lower, the profiles are smooth and practically indistinguishable from a solid diffusion mechanism. During hold and wash steps, at which the interstitial buffer is removed or exchanged, continuation of diffusion of protein molecules is significant for solid diffusion due to the adsorbed phase concentration driving force. For pore diffusion, protein mobility is considerable at low and moderate binding strength. Only when pore diffusion if completely dominant, and the binding strength is very high, protein mobility is low enough to restrict diffusion out of the particles. Simulation of column operation reveals substantial protein loss when operating conditions are not adjusted appropriately.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsPore diffusionSolid diffusionConfocal laser scanning microscopyMechanistic modellingIon exchange chromatographyRecommended articlesCited by (0)\u00a9 2021 The Authors.

The proposed correction leads to a significant improvement in predicting the first-mode dispersion curve of a bar, as shown by comparison with experimental data. Furthermore, the simple differential equation of motion derived from this correction is proven to give an adequate estimate of the transient response of a bar under dynamic excitation.The advantages of the present formulation over other existing theories are twofold. Firstly, it can be applied to bars of any cross-section. Secondly, and more importantly, its treatment is straightforward and its results \u2013 like the dispersion relation and the differential equation of motion it provides \u2013 are easy to use in practical applications.Highlights\u25ba A correction to Bishop's theory for longitudinal wave motion in bars is proposed. \u25ba The correction provides a good estimate of the first-mode dispersion curve of the bar. \u25ba The correction is also capable to predict adequately the transient response of the bar. \u25ba The proposed method is versatile and simple to use.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsElastic longitudinal wavesFirst-mode dispersion curveTransient responseRecommended articlesCited by (0)View AbstractCopyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This book addresses critical issues in the scale-up and optimization of chromatography as a unit operation emphasizing design tools and applications in bio/pharmaceutical manufacturing. The book has two main sections:\u2009 \u201cMethods and Approaches\u201d and \u201cCase Studies\u201d. The first six chapters provide a brief overview of scale-up issues, an analysis of the interplay of momentum and mass transfer in chromatography columns, a discussion of the optimization of productivity and recovery yield of different modes of operation based on numerical methods, a methodology for the scale-up of gradient elution chromatography, and a heuristics-based approach for the design and operation of simulated moving bed (SMB) systems. The remaining chapters provide accounts of industrial scale-up experiences and include timely examples of the separation of recombinant antibody fragments, plasmid DNA, monoclonal IgG, as well as small-molecule pharmaceutical intermediates. Rather than providing a handbook-style treatment, this book seems designed to make the reader think about scale-up issues. This is achieved quite well in Chapter 2, which deals with the interaction of mass transfer and fluid mechanics, and in Chapter 5, which provides a useful intuitive understanding of SMB design and operation. Useful simplified scale-up criteria (valid when intraparticle diffusion is controlling) are presented in Chapter 1, and applications of some of these criteria are illustrated in several of the \u201ccase-study\u201d chapters. Unfortunately, these chapters do not provide examples of the application of the more sophisticated approaches introduced in the first section  of the book. Perhaps this demonstrates the difficulties in implementing these tools within the constraints of cGMP manufacturing and the very fast-paced development needs of the pharmaceutical industry. Overall, this book provides useful coverage of a selection of topics in preparative chromatography, emphasizing the understanding of the underlying phenomena and designs guided by an appropriate combination of simplified theories and experience. It is likely to be most useful to industrial practitioners who are familiar with chromatography as an analytical and process development tool and who want to develop an appreciation for scale-up issues. In addition to providing a starting point for several important separation problems, the case-study chapters also address many of the practical issues encountered in the implementation of chromatography in a manufacturing setting. Readers seeking more in-depth analyses can consult the extensive reference lists accompanying each chapter.

A distributed model, based on partial differential equations describing unsteady mass transfer and reaction at the interface and ordinary differential equations describing reaction in the bulk phases, has been developed. Two reaction systems\u2014an abstract two-variable chemical mechanism and a three-variable kinetic model describing the oxidation of benzaldehyde\u2014have been studied. Numerical simulation and stability analysis reveal that the simultaneous occurrence of mass transfer and reaction at the interface can affect the dynamic behavior. Oscillatory behavior, multiple steady states, and enhancement of the rate of diffusive transport across the interface are predicted by the distributed model; simulation with a simpler mass transfer model (which assumes no reaction near the interface) shows only a single, sometimes oscillatory, stable state.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightRecommended articlesCited by (0)Copyright \u00a9 1990 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNavigate DownNo articles found.Article MetricsNavigate DownView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

At such scales, the columns are highly overloaded heightening the challenge of predicting performance. In this work, the separation of a monoclonal antibody monomer-dimer mixture is conducted by gradient elution chromatography with ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHT) columns Type I and Type II under overloaded conditions. Phosphate gradients are shown to be preferable over sodium chloride gradients since the latter result in undesirable pH transitions generated within the column itself. Using sodium phosphate gradients separation is obtained with both CHT types, achieving approximately 90% recovery at 99% monomer purity starting with a mixture containing 30% dimer at total protein loads up to 30 mg/mL. Because of its higher binding capacity, even higher loadings can be obtained with CHT Type I without monomer breakthrough. A hybrid model is developed to describe the separation. The model, based on an empirical description of two-component, competitive isotherms at low sodium phosphate concentration coupled with the stoichiometric displacement model at higher sodium phosphate concentrations, is in good agreement with the experiments using the linear driving force (LDF) approximation to describe adsorption/desorption kinetics. The same LDF rate coefficient predicts the separation at loadings between 0.8 and 30 mg/mL. The model developed in this work can be used as a general tool to optimize operating conditions, understand what factors limit performance, and compare different operating modes.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsCeramic hydroxyapatiteGradient elution chromatographyMonoclonal antibodiesSeparation of monomer-dimer mixturesModelingRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Current affiliation: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Devens, MA, USA.View Abstract\u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The composite particles were prepared with 6% and 10% agarose and contain 35% and 25% (v/v) CHT, respectively, with effective pore radii of 15.1 and 8.8\u00a0nm. The functional properties were studied using yeast RNA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), thyroglobulin (Tg), IgM, and 30 and 50\u00a0nm silica nanoparticles (NP) as models. The RNA and BSA adsorption capacities are smaller than for unencapsulated CHT on a bead volume basis but comparable when normalized by the volume of CHT particles in the composite beads attaining values between 30 and 40 mg/mL. Confocal laser scanning microscopy shows that, while RNA and BSA have complete access to the encapsulated CHT particles, Tg, IgM, and the NPs are largely excluded. RNA and BSA breakthrough experiments in laboratory-scale columns at a 5-min residence time show RNA and BSA binding capacities comparable to those measured in a batch mode with either single component feeds or with feed mixtures containing 30\u00a0nm NPs.KEYWORDS: Composite adsorbentsceramic hydroxyapatiteagaroseproteinsnanoparticles\n\n\n\n\nIntroductionChromatographic purification in a flow-through mode, where impurities adsorb in the stationary phasewhile the desired bio-particles pass through, is commonly practiced.[1Lee, M. F. X.; Chan, E. S.; Tey, B. T. Negative Chromatography: Progress, Applications and Future Perspectives. Process Biochem. 2014, 49, 1005\u20131011.\u00a0[Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] Although large bioparticles are typically excluded from the pores of most stationary phases because of their size, binding on the outer surface of the chromatographic particles can still occur. In this case, even though the external surface is small compared to the intraparticle surface, if the concentration of the bio-particle is small, even a low amount of surface binding can impair performance by reducing yield. Additionally, such bio-particle binding can occlude the pores limiting or preventing impurities from accessing the particle interior. Preventing surface binding is, thus, generally desirable for flow-through purification. Core-shell particles, where an inert shell surrounds an adsorbing core, have been developed for this purpose. Gustavsson et al.[2Gustavsson, P. E.; Lemmens, R.; Nyhammar, T.; Busson, P.; Larsson, P. O. Purification of Plasmid DNA with a New Type of Anion-exchange Beads Having a Non-charged Surface. J.

These investigators were able to purify plasmid DNA by removing RNA and proteins from cell lysates. Currently, two such core-shell adsorbents are commercially available from Cytiva (Marlborough, MA, USA), Capto Core 700 and Capto Core 400. These resins consist of agarose-based beads whose core is functionalized with an octylamine ligand while leaving a thin inert layer at the bead outer surface[3\u20135Ovalbumin removal in egg-based influenza vaccine production using Capto Core 700, Application note 29-1037-62 AA 09/2014, Cytiva Global Life Sciences Solutions USA LLC, Marlborough, MA, USA (2014).\u00a0[Google Scholar]S\u00e1nchez-Trasvi\u00f1a, C.; Fuks, P.; Mushagasha, C.; Kimerer, L.; Mayolo-Deloisa, K.; Rito-Palomares, M.; Carta, G.

A. 2021, 1651, 462314.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]]Hydroxyapatite is a nano-crystalline material with mixed-mode interaction properties. The crystal surface exhibits both negatively charged phosphate groups (P-sites) and positively charged calcium ions (C-sites) and is, thus, capable of interacting with both basic and acidic proteins as well as with nucleic acids.[9Gorbunoff, M. J. The Interaction of Proteins with Hydroxyapatite: II. Role of Acidic and Basic Groups. Anal. Biochem. 1984, 136, 433\u2013439.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] Interactions of basic proteins with P-sites are modulated through non-binding salts, such as NaCl, that screen electrostatics. Conversely, interactions of acidic proteins and nucleic acids with C-sites are modulated by displacing salts, such as phosphate.[9Gorbunoff, M. J. The Interaction of Proteins with Hydroxyapatite: II. Role of Acidic and Basic Groups. Anal. Biochem. 1984, 136, 433\u2013439.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar],10Gorbunoff, M. J.; Timasheff, S. N.

Biochem. 1984, 136, 440\u2013445.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] This mixed-mode nature makes hydroxyapatite attractive for a wide range of separations.[11Cummings, L. J.; Snyder, M. A.; Brisack, K. Protein Chromatography on Hydroxyapatite Columns. Methods Enzymol. 2009, 463, 387\u2013404.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] For process applications, ceramic hydroxyapatite particles (CHT), produced by spray-drying hydroxyapatite nanocrystals followed by sintering at high temperature, are normally used. The CHT particles consist of a conglomerate of nanoparticles defining a rigid macroporous structure with pore radius in the 30\u201350\u00a0nm range, respectively. Adsorbates diffuse in the macropores and bind to the nanocrystal surfaces. Since the pores are relatively large, even large molecules, such as IgG and IgM, can diffuse in and bind. Typical particle sizes are in the 40\u201380\u00a0\u03bcm range. Various process applications of CHT have been demonstrated, including the purification of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies,[12Freitag, R.; Hilberg, F.

For example, the CHT-based purification of VLPs can result in low yield due to difficulties in eluting VLPs that are bound to the bead surface.[19Wang, Y.;, Understanding the chromatographic processing of recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine using ceramic hydroxyapatite, M.S. Thesis, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA (2016).\u00a0[Google Scholar]] In these cases, reducing or eliminating binding on the external surface of the CHT particles can be beneficial.The objective of this work is to develop and characterize a composite chromatographic medium comprising CHT particles encapsulated in inert agarose beads. Agarose is a hydrophilic polysaccharide that forms hydrogels with tunable pore size. It is often used as the base matrix for chromatography resins because of the ease with which it can be produced in bead form, crosslinked, and functionalized and because of its inert character that prevents nonspecific binding. Various commercial resins including Sepharose and Capto from Cytiva (Marlborough, MA, USA) and Praesto from Purolite Life Sciences (King of Prussia, PA, USA) are based on agarose and are used extensively with a variety of ligands.[20Jungbauer, A. Chromatographic Media for Bioseparation. J. Chromatogr. A. 2005, 1065, 3\u201312.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] Agarose has also been used previously to entrap hydroxyapatite microcrystals and a commercial product based on this approach is currently available under the trade name HA Ultrogel\u00ae.[21HA Ultrogel\u00ae - Hydroxyapatite Chromatography Resin, Product Datasheet DIR: 2578759-000-01, Status: 07/2020; Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH: Goettingen, Germany, 2020.\u00a0[Google Scholar]] In this material, hydroxyapatite microcrystals are dispersed throughout the agarose. The binding capacity for bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been reported to be less than 7 mg/mL and the size exclusion limit has been reported to be greater than 5,000 kDa.[21HA Ultrogel\u00ae - Hydroxyapatite Chromatography Resin, Product Datasheet DIR: 2578759-000-01, Status: 07/2020; Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH: Goettingen, Germany, 2020.\u00a0[Google Scholar]] Thus, because of the large size exclusion limit, it is evident that this composite material was not designed for the exclusion of large molecules, but mainly to support and stabilize the entrapped hydroxyapatite microcrystals. Fargues et al.[22Fargues, C.; Bailly, M.; Grevillot, G. Adsorption of BSA and Hemoglobin on Hydroxyapatite Support: Equilibria and Multicomponent Dynamic Adsorption. Adsorption. 1998, 4, 5\u201316.\u00a0[Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] have studied the adsorption of BSA and hemoglobin on this material. The BSA binding capacity was reported to be near zero at pH 7.5 increasing to about 10 mg per g of dry gel at pH 6.78 and to about 65 mg per g of dry gel at pH 5.7. Based on their reported values of the dry gel content of packed columns (0.16\u00a0\u00b1 0.01\u00a0g dry gel/mL), these BSA capacity values correspond to values between 1.6 and 10 mg per mL of column volume at pH 6.78 and 5.7, respectively. While the capacity reported is higher at the lower pH, hydroxyapatite is known to be unstable in solutions at pH below about 6.5 where it dissolves rapidly.[23Bankston, T.; Dattolo, L.; Carta, G. pH Transients in Hydroxyapatite Chromatography Columns - Experimental Evidence and Phenomenological Modeling. J. Chromatogr. A. 2010, 1217, 2123\u20132131.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] Thus, operation at pH 5.7 is likely to be impractical. A higher capacity around 17 mg/mL was reported for hemoglobin at pH 6.7, indicating that this material may be better suited for the adsorption of cationic proteins.In our approach, instead of encapsulating hydroxyapatite crystals, we encapsulate whole CHT particles. As a result, we preserve the macroporous structure of the CHT particles while introducing the size exclusion properties of the inert agarose. Encapsulation is obtained via an emulsification method wherein the CHT particles are first mixed in a heated agarose solution which is then emulsified in a hot organic solvent creating a droplet phase consisting of agarose and CHT. Upon cooling, the agarose droplets gel forming agarose-CHT composite beads, which are then crosslinked to improve stability and flow properties. This preparation method was chosen to allow for independent control over the agarose concentration and CHT type and content.Encapsulating CHT particles inside agarose beads creates a composite material with complementary separation mechanisms: separation by molecular size, resulting from the tunable agarose structure, and adsorption occurring within the encapsulated CHT particles. The combination of these mechanisms results in an adsorbent suited for flow-through separations of large proteins and bioparticles, such as viruses, virus-like particles, and large vaccine molecules. Importantly, the agarose prevents surface binding of these bioparticles that may otherwise occur on bare CHT particles.In this work, the composite beads were prepared under a range of shearing rates, surfactant concentrations, CHT concentrations, and agarose concentrations to determine under what conditions they produce materials suitable for chromatographic applications. Light microscopy, inverse size exclusion chromatography (iSEC), and density measurements were used to characterize their structure. Static and dynamic binding capacity measurements were used to determine their functional properties using RNA and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as models for small contaminants and thyroglobulin (Tg), IgM, and 30 and 50\u00a0nm silica nanoparticles as models of large protein and bioparticle products. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to determine the location of bound species within the composite particles and the kinetics of binding of RNA and BSA. Finally, column experiments were used to determine the binding capacity and flow-through characteristics at practical residence times.Materials and methodsMaterialsThe CHT sample used in this work was provided by Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA) and is CHT Type-I with a mean particle diameter of 40\u00a0\u00b5m.

B.; Carta, G. Protein Adsorption in Charged Agarose Gels Studied by Light Microscopy. AIChE J. 2007, 53, 1472\u20131482.\u00a0[Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar],32Schirmer, E. B.; Carta, G. Protein Adsorption Kinetics in Charged Agarose Gels: Effect of Agarose Content and Modeling. AIChE J. 2009, 55, 331\u2013341.\u00a0[Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] to produce plain agarose beads. The steps are illustrated in Fig. 1 along with a schematic of the equipment used. CHT particles are first washed with distilled deionized water to remove fines, oven dried for 4\u00a0h at 115\u00a0oC, and then placed in a 30-mL beaker containing a pre-weighed amount of dry agarose followed by the addition of 10 mL of degassed, deionized water. The beaker is then placed in a double boiler at 100\u00a0oC on a hot plate and the contents are mixed by pipetting the mixture in and out for 10\u00a0min to ensure an even distribution of the CHT particles throughout the agarose solution until reaching a temperature of 95\u00a0oC. No settling of the CHT particles was observed after mixing, likely because of the high viscosity of the agarose solution. The hot suspension is then loaded into a syringe heated with heating tape with a voltage controller obtained from Allied Electronics and Automation (Fort Worth, TX, USA) for dropwise addition into a 100 mL baffled and stirred jacketed glass reaction vessel, obtained from Chemglass Life Sciences (Vineland, NJ, USA), containing 2% (v/v) Span 85 in cyclohexane kept at 60\u00a0oC by circulating water from a high-temperature bath through the vessel jacket. The final ratio of agarose-CHT suspension to cyclohexane was 1:40 (v/v). Care was taken to ensure safety during the syringe loading of the hot suspension by wearing heat-resistant gloves. Due to the small scale and the modest viscosity at 95\u00a0oC, manual injection into the reaction vessel could be conducted safely. For larger scale, the hand-operated syringe could be replaced by a pump. Two different types of stirrers were tested. The first is an overhead stirrer obtained from Caframo Lab Solutions (Ontario, Canada) and fitted with a 5-cm diameter impeller with two pitched blades and operated at 2,000 rpm. The second is a Model IKA T-18 rotor-stator homogenizer obtained from IKA-Werke (Staufen im Breisgau, Germany) and operated at different speeds between 5,000 and 22,000 rpm. After mixing for 10\u00a0min, the suspension is cooled in about 30 s by changing the direction of flow with the 3-way valves from the hot water bath to the 25oC water bath followed by 5\u00a0min of additional stirring at 25oC. The composite beads are then collected by opening the vessel drain valve over a 20-\u00b5m mesh screen and washed with a 20% ethanol/water solution (v/v) at room temperature. The washed beads are then crosslinked according to the procedure described in.[31Schirmer, E. B.; Carta, G. Protein Adsorption in Charged Agarose Gels Studied by Light Microscopy. AIChE J. 2007, 53, 1472\u20131482.\u00a0[Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar],33Stone, M. C.; Carta, G.

A. 2007, 1216, 4465\u20134474.\u00a0[Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] For this purpose, the beads are added to a tube containing 1.0 mL of 1\u00a0N NaOH, 0.45 mL of deionized water, and 0.23 mL of epichlorohydrin, each per mL of settled particles, gently rotated end-over-end for 3\u00a0h at room temperature (21\u00a0\u00b1 1\u00a0oC). After crosslinking, the beads are washed with 20% ethanol, sieved between screens with apertures of 300 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm, and stored. The CHT content of the precursor suspension was varied between 0.04 and 0.25\u00a0g dry CHT per mL of agarose solution. Two different values of the agarose content were tested: 0.06\u00a0g agarose per mL of water (6%) and 0.10\u00a0g agarose per mL of water (10%). Agarose-only beads with 6% and 10% agarose content were also synthesized as described above using the homogenizer at a stirring speed of 5,000 rpm. Preparation and characterization of agarose-encapsulated ceramic hydroxyapatite particles for flow-through chromatographyAll authorsPreston E. Fuks & Giorgio Cartahttps://doi.org/10.1080/01496395.2022.2026388Published online:18 January 2022Figure 1.  Steps used to prepare agarose-CHT composite beads (left) and schematic of experimental apparatus (right)Display full sizeFigure 1.  Steps used to prepare agarose-CHT composite beads (left) and schematic of experimental apparatus (right)The CHT particles are small in size and easily wet by the agarose solution, which is relatively viscous. Thus, premixing the CHT with the agarose solution results in a stable suspension with uniformly dispersed CHT particles. Extrusion of this suspension through the syringe needle in the agitated cyclohexane results in an emulsion consisting of agarose droplets as the dispersed phase in cyclohexane as the continuous phase. In the final product, when the CHT content of the agarose suspension is high, the CHT particles appear as if they were clustered together. However, the particles are actually dispersed within the droplets.Physical properties characterizationThe overall morphology and bead size distribution of the composite beads were obtained from micrographs obtained using a Hirox RH-8800 Light Microscope (Tokyo, Japan) using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) for image analysis. Encapsulation efficiencies were calculated by recording the number of beads containing CHT particles relative to the total number of beads. The distribution of CHT particles within the composite beads was visualized by first dehydrating the beads in a water-ethanol gradient from 0% to 100% (v/v) anhydrous ethanol in 20% increments. Upon completion of the 100% ethanol wash, the beads were washed with 50% (v/v) LR White embedding resin (obtained from VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) dissolved in ethanol followed by a wash with pure LR White and finally allowed to set for 24\u00a0h at 45\u00a0oC. After setting, the LR White-embedded samples were microtomed into 1\u00a0\u00b5m thick slices, stained with toluidine blue, and imaged with the Hirox RH-8800 microscope.The density of the hydrated composite particles, \u03c1AgCHT, was determined using a picnometer. Their CHT content on a mass fraction basis, \u03c7CHT, was determined gravimetrically by placing weighed samples of the hydrated AgCHT particles in a quartz tube furnace (Model GSL 1100X, MTI Corporation, Richmond, CA, USA) at 400\u00a0oC for 2\u00a0h. Finally, the volume fraction of CHT particles in the hydrated composite beads, \u03d5CHT in mL of CHT particles per mL of bead, was calculated from the following equation: (1) \u03d5CHT=\u03c1AgCHT\u00d7\u03c7CHT\u03c1s,CHT1\u2212\u2208p,CHT(1) where \u03c1s,CHT = 3.1\u00a0g/mL is the skeletal density of the CHT particles and \u2208p,CHT = 0.73 is their porosity.The size-exclusion limit, porosity, and pore size of the composite beads were determined by inverse size exclusion chromatography (iSEC) using glucose and dextran standards ranging from 4 to 2,000 kDa as described in.[33Stone, M. C.; Carta, G. Protein Adsorption and Transport in Agarose and Dextran-grafted Agarose Media for Ion Exchange Chromatography. J. Chromatogr. A. 2007, 1216, 4465\u20134474.\u00a0[Crossref], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] The iSEC experiments were performed by packing the AgCHT samples into 0.5 cm diameter Tricorn 10/100 columns (obtained from Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) to bed heights between 9.1 and 14.8 cm and operated at flow rates giving a residence time of 10\u00a0min. Separate pulse injections (20\u00a0\u00b5L) of 5 mg/mL samples were made for each dextran using a Waters HPLC system monitored with a R401 refractive index detector (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase was 200\u00a0mM sodium phosphate containing 250\u00a0mM sodium chloride at pH 7. The distribution coefficient, Kc, was calculated for each standard from the following equation: (2) Kc=VRVc\u221211\u2212\u03b5(2) where VR is the retention volume calculated from the peak first moment, Vc is the column volume, and \u03b5 is the extraparticle or external porosity. The latter was calculated from the retention volume of the 2,000 kDa dextran assuming that it is completely excluded. Based on the cylindrical pore model, Kc is theoretically related to the molecular radius by[33Stone, M. C.; Carta, G. Protein Adsorption and Transport in Agarose and Dextran-grafted Agarose Media for Ion Exchange Chromatography. J. Chromatogr.

The same method was also used to determine the porosity and pore radius of agarose-only beads prepared with 6% and 10% agarose.Functional propertiesAll adsorption experiments were done at room temperature (21\u00a0\u00b1 1oC) in buffers containing 5\u00a0mM NaH2PO4 and 250\u00a0mM NaCl adjusted to pH 7 by the addition of phosphoric acid. Adsorption isotherms were obtained by mixing known quantities of hydrated beads in tubes containing 1.5 mL solutions of BSA or RNA at initial concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 4.5 mg/mL gently rotated end-over-end for 24\u00a0h. The initial and final supernatant concentrations were measured with a Nanodrop 2000\u00a0c spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the amount of BSA or RNA bound was calculated by mass balance. Adsorption capacities were expressed as the bound mass divided by the bead volume as well as the bound mass divided by the volume of CHT particles within the beads.Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to visualize the distribution of bound RNA, BSA, Tg, IgM, and silica nanoparticles in the beads. For this purpose, the protein samples were conjugated to either Rhodamine Green-X or Rhodamine Red-X amine-reactive dyes, obtained from Life Technologies (Waltham, MA, USA), following the method described in.[35Zhu, M.; Carta, G. Adsorption of Polyethylene-glycolated Bovine Serum Albumin on Macroporous and Polymer-grafted Anion Exchangers. J. Chromatogr. A. 2014, 1326, 29\u201338.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] The degree of labeling after conjugation was 28%, 19%, and 55% for BSA, Tg, and IgM, respectively. RNA was labeled using a UlysisTM Alexa FluorTM 647 labeling kit, obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA), by first dissolving 25 mg/mL of RNA into the supplied labeling buffer and then denaturing the RNA to facilitate labeling by holding the solution for 5\u00a0min at 95\u00a0oC followed by snap cooling on ice. A 20\u00a0\u03bcL aliquot of the labeling complex was then added to the denatured RNA solution and heated to 90oC for 10\u00a0min followed again by snap cooling on ice. Finally, unreacted dye was removed using a centrifugal Bio-Rad P-30 buffer exchange column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at 1,000\u00a0g for 4\u00a0min.In each case, the labeled samples were spiked into the corresponding unconjugated sample to obtain a final 1:40 ratio.Batch CLSM measurements were done by mixing small resin samples, dosed in amounts estimated to yield less than a 10% drop in supernatant concentration, with 10 mL of solution in 15 mL tubes gently rotated end-over-end. At various times, small samples of the suspension were pipetted out and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 30 s in nylon Spin-X microfiltration tubes (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) to remove the supernatant. The filtered beads were then resuspended in benzyl alcohol, which matches, approximately, the refractive index of CHT and imaged as described in.[24Wang, Y.; Carta, G. Competitive Binding of Monoclonal Antibody Monomer-dimer Mixtures on Ceramic Hydroxyapatite. J. Chromatogr. A. 2018, 1587, 136\u2013145.\u00a0[Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science \u00ae],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] Unfortunately, benzyl alcohol causes the encapsulating agarose gel to shrink dramatically which distorts the original shape of the beads. This step is, however, necessary to visualize binding within the CHT particles that are otherwise opaque in an aqueous buffer.Breakthrough curves were obtained for one-component feeds containing either BSA, RNA, or Tg and for mixtures of the 30\u00a0nm nanoparticles with either BSA or RNA. These experiments were done with an AKTATM Prime 25 system (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) at a residence time of 5\u00a0min, corresponding to flow rates between 0.3 and 0.4 mL/min with the same columns used for the iSEC experiments. For BSA and Tg, detection was at 280\u00a0nm, while for RNA detection was at 305\u00a0nm. Detection at the more typical 260\u00a0nm could not be used for RNA since the corresponding absorbance was too high to be monitored by the AKTA system. A linear relationship between A305 and RNA concentration was verified by serial dilution. For the two-component feeds, detection was at 280 and 485\u00a0nm for BSA/nanoparticle mixtures and at 305 and 485\u00a0nm for RNA/nanoparticle mixtures. Given that, in both cases, only the nanoparticles absorb significantly at 485\u00a0nm, the breakthrough of each component was determined by deconvoluting the 280/485\u00a0nm signals for the BSA/nanoparticle mixtures and the 305/485\u00a0nm signals for the RNA/nanoparticle mixtures. After each run, the column was eluted with a 10 CV gradient from 5 to 505\u00a0mM NaH2PO4 at pH 7 followed by a 2 CV wash at the final phosphate concentration.Results and discussionsEffect of bead preparation parametersSeveral parameters were varied initially to determine conditions suitable for the preparation of agarose-CHT composites with size and CHT content appropriate for flow-through purifications. We quantified the fraction of beads recovered between 300 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm screens along with the fraction of beads in this size range that contained CHT particles obtained for different preparation conditions. Table 2 shows the results obtained by varying the mixer type, rpm, and the CHT content of the precursor agarose-CHT suspension. As seen in this table, using the impeller mixer at 2,000 rpm resulted in a relatively low fraction (25%) of beads in the 100\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm size range. A much higher fraction (70%) was obtained with the homogenizer at higher speeds up to 18,000 rpm. Even higher speeds were also tested but were found to disrupt the particles. Table 2 also shows that the encapsulation efficiency increases with the CHT content of the precursor agarose solution, attaining values close to 100% at a CHT content of 0.14\u00a0g/mL or higher in the precursor suspension.Preparation and characterization of agarose-encapsulated ceramic hydroxyapatite particles for flow-through chromatographyAll authorsPreston E.

We also tested the effect of varying the Span 85 concentration in cyclohexane in the 2\u20138% (v/v) range with the impeller mixer at 2,000 rpm, but no significant effect was observed.

Hereinafter, we refer to these materials as 6%AgCHT and 10%AgCHT.Physical properties of 6%AgCHT and 10%AgCHTTable 3 provides a summary of the physical properties of 6%AgCHT and 10%AgCHT prepared as described in the Methods section.Preparation and characterization of agarose-encapsulated ceramic hydroxyapatite particles for flow-through chromatographyAll authorsPreston E.

Since the two materials were prepared with the same mixer at the same rpm, the larger size of the 10%AgCHT beads is likely a result of the increased viscosity of the 10% agarose precursor suspension.

In these images, obtained by embedding and physically sectioning the samples as described in 2.2.2 the Methods section, the encapsulated CHT particles appear somewhat darker than the surrounding agarose since they are much denser. Comparing these images with those in Fig. 2 for the non-embedded beads, it is evident that embedding and physical sectioning cause significant deformation of the beads and, likely, some shrinkage of the agarose. Moreover, since the beads are randomly located in the embedded sample, the sections shown do not necessarily correspond to the equator of each bead. Despite these limitations, we can conclude that the CHT particles are randomly distributed within the encapsulating agarose and that there are virtually no un-encapsulated CHT particles.

Using the skeletal density and porosity of the CHT particles listed in Table 1, we can calculate that the CHT particle content in the precursor suspension was 28% (v/v). Thus, the values obtained for the composite beads are similar to the CHT content of the precursor suspension once the fraction of beads without CHT is accounted for. An important question is whether it may be possible to obtain higher volume fractions. Huang and Yu[36Huang, W. Q.; Yu, L. A Quasi Physical Method for the Equal Sphere Packing Problem, Proceedings of the 11th International Joint Conference of IEEE TrustCOM/IEEE ICESS-11/FCST-11, Changsha, Hunan, China, (2011) 1684\u20131690, DOI https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2011.233.\u00a0[Crossref],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] have analyzed the problem of how many spheres can be physically packed into a larger sphere. Their results show that this number depends on the ratio of the radii of the smaller spheres and of the larger one that contains them. For the 6%AgCHT beads, which have a mean diameter of 105\u00a0\u03bcm, this ratio is 41/105\u00a0= 0.390, which, according to Huang and Yu, corresponds to a maximum between 6 and 7 spheres packed within the larger one. The corresponding volume fraction is then predicted to be between 6\u00d70.3903 =0.357 and 7\u00d70.3903= 0.417. Our experimental value of 0.36 is in this range, suggesting that it would be difficult to obtain a much larger CHT content. The same calculation for the 10%AgCHT beads, which are larger, yields a ratio of radii of 0.20 and a predicted maximum volume fraction of 0.528. This value is considerably larger than our experimentally determined one, indicating that, for 10%AgCHT, the CHT volume fraction is limited by the CHT content of the precursor suspension. In turn, this suggests that, theoretically, a higher CHT content might be obtained starting with a denser CHT suspension. On the other, we found that it was difficult to obtain a uniform dispersion of the CHT particles at higher suspension densities in large part because of the high viscosity of the agarose solution. Thus, although, in theory, higher inner particle densities may be achieved, these higher values may be difficult to obtain in practice.Figure 5 shows the iSEC results for both 6%AgCHT and 10%AgCHT along with the corresponding values obtained for 6% and 10% agarose beads without CHT. As seen from Fig. 5, there is only a small difference in size exclusion properties between the AgCHT beads and the agarose-only beads with the same agarose content, suggesting that the size exclusion properties are determined largely by the agarose phase. Conversely, as expected, the agarose content has a large effect, resulting in a size exclusion limit that decreases from about 15\u00a0nm radius to about 9\u00a0nm radius as the agarose content is increased from 6% to 10%. Figure 5 also shows lines based on eq. 3 fitted to the data. The regressed parameter values for 6%AgCHT and 10%AgCHT are given in Table 3. The corresponding values for the agarose-only beads are \u03b5p = 0.98\u00a0\u00b1 0.02 and rpore = 15.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.5\u00a0nm for 6% agarose and \u03b5p = 0.97\u00a0\u00b1 0.04 and rpore = 8.6\u00a0\u00b1 0.5\u00a0nm for 10% agarose. As seen from these results, encapsulating CHT reduces the porosity significantly but does not affect the effective pore radius. Conversely, increasing the agarose content from 6% to 10% reduces the effective pore size nearly two-fold with both agarose contents.

Lines are fitted to the Langmuir isotherm, q=qmKLC/1+KLC, to guide the eye.When compared on a bead volume basis, the binding capacities of the composite AgCHT beads for BSA and RNA are much smaller than the corresponding capacities obtained for CHT alone. On the other hand, when these capacities are compared based on the volume of CHT particles, whether alone or agarose-encapsulated, the results are in much closer agreement with each other for both BSA and RNA. This result suggests that the agarose does not affect the binding capacity of the encapsulated CHT particles in a major way. The hydrodynamic radii of both BSA and of the RNA used are considerably smaller than the size exclusion limit of both 6%AgCHT and 10%AgCHT so that relatively rapid adsorption is expected. For BSA, the 6%AgCHT data and those for CHT alone are essentially coincident, while the 10%AgCHT values are about 20% smaller indicating that some of the CHT binding sites may become inaccessible in 10% agarose. This trend is reversed for RNA, with 6%AgCHT and 10%AgCHT showing close agreement with each other and the CHT-only capacity being, on average, about 25% smaller. The bulk of the RNA used in these experiments is much smaller than BSA (2.2 vs. 3.7\u00a0nm radius). Thus, we expect that RNA will be less affected by the presence of agarose. On the other hand, the RNA sample also contains a fraction of larger size that may be more significantly affected at the higher agarose content.Figure 7 shows CLSM images of CHT, 6%AgCHT, and 10%AgCHT exposed, individually, to RNA, BSA, Tg, and IgM, and to the 30 and 50\u00a0nm silica nanoparticles over long times (30\u2013120\u00a0min). Each CLSM image represents, approximately, the bead equatorial section. Optical microscopy images are also shown digitally superimposed to the CLSM images. As noted in 2.2.3 the Methods section, the composite beads are deformed when they are placed in benzyl alcohol and no longer appear spherical as they did in their hydrated state. Placing the benzyl alcohol saturated beads in an aqueous buffer was observed to restore the original spherical bead shape by re-swelling the agarose. Thus, benzyl alcohol only shrinks the agarose but does not appear to disrupt it. As a result, we conclude that the encapsulated CHT particles are retained within each bead during the process used to image them.

Images are taken in benzyl alcohol. The scale bar in each image is 25\u00a0\u00b5m.As seen in Fig. 7, RNA binds to unencapsulated CHT as well as to the AgCHT beads saturating all the encapsulated CHT particles. This also occurs for BSA in CHT only and in 6%AgCHT. However, in 10%AgCHT, even after 60\u00a0min, saturation of the encapsulated CHT particles is obviously incomplete. In the case of Tg and IgM, binding on unencapsulated CHT occurs primarily in a relatively thin shell at the particle surface. In contrast, there is essentially no binding of either Tg or IgM in any of the encapsulated CHT particles. Some Tg and IgM do appear to be present at the bead surface. However, this bound layer is very thin and not uniformly distributed over the bead surface. Results similar to those obtained for Tg and IgM are also observed for the 30 and 50\u00a0nm silica nanoparticles. In both cases, the nanoparticles diffuse and bind to a limited but significant extent in unencapsulated CHT. However, there is essentially no binding of either nanoparticle to any of the encapsulated CHT particles. In this case too, however, there appears to be some nanoparticle binding at the outer bead surface. It is possible that this binding results, at least in part, from the shrinking that occurs when the AgCHT beads are placed in benzyl alcohol to prepare them for CLSM.Figure 8 shows the time course of adsorption of RNA and BSA in 6%AgCHT and in 10%AgCHT. Only the CLSM images, taken with benzyl alcohol, are shown in this case. As seen from this figure, RNA binds relatively quickly to the CHT particles in both 6%AgCHT and 10%AgCHT. BSA also binds relatively quickly to the CHT particles in 6%AgCHT. However, binding in 10%AgCHT appears to be slow.

The scale bar in each image is 25\u00a0\u00b5m.The results shown in Figs. 7 and 8 are generally consistent with the size exclusion properties determined by iSEC and with the size of these test proteins and nanoparticles. As shown, for example, in,[37Carta, G.; Jungbauer, A. Protein Chromatography - Process Development and Scale-up; Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, Germany, 2020.\u00a0[Crossref],\u00a0[Google Scholar]] diffusion is expected to be highly hindered when the ratio of molecule and pore radii exceeds about 0.2. As shown in Table 4, the effective pore size of 6%AgCHT is 15.1\u00a0nm. As a result, RNA (rm/rpore ~ 0.15 based on the predominant radius of 2.2\u00a0nm) and BSA (rm/rpore ~ 0.25) can diffuse in rapidly. Conversely, diffusion of Tg (rm/rpore ~ 0.58) and IgM (rm/rpore ~ 0.84) is expected to be extremely slow. This effect is exacerbated in 10%AgCHT, whose pore radius is 8.8\u00a0nm. In this case, diffusion of BSA (rm/rpore ~ 0.42) is also expected to become very slow while both Tg and IgM are expected to be essentially completely excluded. In both 6% and 10%AgCHT, both nanoparticles are also expected to be essentially completely excluded since their sizes are close to or exceed the effective pore size.Preparation and characterization of agarose-encapsulated ceramic hydroxyapatite particles for flow-through chromatographyAll authorsPreston E.

The concentration of each feed component was 1 mg/mL.\nDownload CSVDisplay TableFigure 9 shows the breakthrough curves obtained for one component feeds containing 1 mg/mL BSA or 1 mg/mL Tg plotted vs. the ratio of load volume and column volume, V/Vc, in (a) and (c) and vs. the ratio of load volume and volume of CHT particles, V/VCHT, in (b) and (d). The CHT volume was calculated as VCHT=1\u2212\u03b5\u03d5CHT\u00d7Vc. As seen in Fig. 9a, the BSA binding capacity per unit column volume is much larger for the unencapsulated CHT column than for the 6%AgCHT column as indicated by the horizontal shift of the breakthrough profile. However, as seen in Fig. 9b, the two curves come to a much closer agreement when plotted vs. V/VCHT, suggesting that the BSA binding capacity per mL of CHT particles is essentially the same whether the CHT particles are encapsulated or not. Even so, the 6%AgCHT breakthrough curve on the V/VCHT basis is considerably shallower than the CHT-only column. This result stems in large part from the fact that the 6%AgCHT beads are much larger in diameter compared to the CHT particles (105 vs. 40\u00a0\u03bcm), which, in turn, results in a greater mass transfer resistance and, thus, a shallower breakthrough curve. For the 10%AgCHT column, breakthrough of BSA occurs almost immediately at this residence time, which is consistent with the even larger bead size of this material and with the slower binding kinetics shown in Fig. 9b resulting from the smaller effective pore size.

The curves are plotted in (a) and (c) vs. the ratio of load volume and column volume and in (b) and (d) vs. the ratio of load volume and CHT volume.The Tg breakthrough curves (Figs. 9c a\u2006nd d) show that substantial binding occurs in the CHT-only column. However, the binding kinetics is slow (cf. Figure 7) so that the CHT-only breakthrough does not have the characteristic S-shape seen in cases where mass transfer is relatively fast. Conversely, only minimal Tg binding occurs in the 6%AgCHT column and no binding at all appears to occur in the 10%AgCHT column. Both of 6% and 10%AgCHT exclude Tg almost completely so that breakthrough occurs in the column void volume. This result suggests that the AgCHT columns can be used to remove small protein impurities (e.g., BSA with 6%AgCHT or smaller proteins with 10%AgCHT) from a Tg feed in a flow-through mode with virtually no loss of Tg.Figure 10 shows the two-component breakthrough curves for mixtures of 30\u00a0nm silica nanoparticles with BSA (a) and with RNA (b) for the 6%AgCHT column at a residence time of 5\u00a0min compared to the corresponding one-component BSA and RNA breakthrough curves. The mixture experiments are meant to exemplify a hypothetical flow-through purification of a large bioparticle from smaller contaminating proteins or nucleic acids. In both cases, the nanoparticles break through almost immediately, mostly at the column void volume, which is marked by the vertical dashed line. Some retention of nanoparticles is evident, however, from the breakthrough curves shown. This is likely due to the relatively broad distribution of nanoparticle radii in the sample used, which spans the range 8\u201326\u00a0nm (Fig. S2). Based on the average pore radius of 15.1\u00a0nm determined for 6%AgCHT (Table 3), some retention of the smaller nanoparticles in the sample can, in fact, be expected. For both the BSA/NP mixture and for the RNA/NP mixture, the BSA and RNA breakthrough curves are essentially the same as those observed with the corresponding one-component BSA and RNA feeds.

The EBC values are given both per mL of column and per mL of beads. For the RNA/NP mixture, the amount of feed loaded was insufficient to attain saturation. Thus, the calculated EBC is a lower-bound estimate. As seen in Table 4, there is substantial agreement between the capacity values obtained for each one-component and two-component feeds indicating that the presence of the nanoparticles does not affect BSA and RNA binding. The EBC values expressed in terms of mL of beads are also in close agreement with the isotherm values shown in Figs. 6a a\u2006nd b.The results in Fig. 10 show that an early breakthrough occurs for RNA (Fig. 10b) either alone or with the RNA/NP mixture, but not for BSA (Fig. 10a). To understand the underlying reasons for the early RNA breakthrough, we collected 0.2 CV fractions along the breakthrough curve and analyzed each fraction to determine the A260/A280 ratio as well as the size distribution by UPLC SEC as described in the Methods section 2.1. We also analyzed the eluate from the column obtained with the phosphate gradient described in the 2.2.3 Methods section. The results of these analyses, given in Table S1 and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Material, show that fractions collected between 0 and 3 CV (Fig. 10b) had A260/A280 substantially higher than the feed value. Moreover, they contained species with molecular size much smaller than the feed. Taken together, these results indicate that the early breakthrough behavior is caused by the presence of unbound or weakly bound species present in the RNA sample. Fractions collected between 5 and 20 CV, as well as the eluted RNA had A260/A280 values and molecular size consistent with the bulk of the RNA feed.A final consideration regards the recovery of the bound proteins upon eluting the saturated columns with the phosphate gradient described in the 2.2.3 Methods section. Recoveries were calculated from the elution peak for the runs with one-component BSA and Tg feeds and with the BSA/30\u00a0nm nanoparticles feed. The results, shown in Table 5, show that BSA and Tg recoveries were nearly quantitative even after multiple runs loading BSA, Tg, and RNA to complete saturation and eluting indicating that the elution procedure used was effective and did not impact the column performance in subsequent runs. The similarity between the results for the CHT-only columns and those obtained with the AgCHT columns also indicates that the agarose encapsulation does not impact recovery.Preparation and characterization of agarose-encapsulated ceramic hydroxyapatite particles for flow-through chromatographyAll authorsPreston E.

The agarose prevents adsorption of the larger species to the encapsulated CHT without affecting the ability of smaller species to diffuse in and bind. The agarose also largely eliminates binding to the external bead surface. An advantage of the method used to prepare the composite beads is that the size exclusion properties can be adjusted by selecting the agarose content. 6%AgCHT is ideal for the flow-through-based removal of impurities up to 5\u00a0nm, whereas the 10%AgCHT is suitable only for smaller impurities. The BSA and RNA binding capacities obtained for our composite materials are comparable to those observed for CHT-only when based on the volume of CHT particles. On the other hand, because of the limited volume fraction of CHT particles within the beads, the binding capacities become relatively small when based on the total bead volume. As shown in Fig. 2, the CHT content within the agarose beads is primarily controlled by the mass of CHT in the agarose precursor suspension. The CHT volume fraction in the finished beads determines the binding capacity for impurities, in our case BSA and RNA, that can be bound during a flowthrough separation. Therefore, higher CHT volume fractions are advantageous. For the 6% composite particles the volume of CHT encapsulated within the agarose beads approached the theoretical limit (see ref.[36Huang, W. Q.; Yu, L. A Quasi Physical Method for the Equal Sphere Packing Problem, Proceedings of the 11th International Joint Conference of IEEE TrustCOM/IEEE ICESS-11/FCST-11, Changsha, Hunan, China, (2011) 1684\u20131690, DOI https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2011.233.\u00a0[Crossref],\u00a0[Google Scholar]]) indicating that it would be difficult to achieve higher CHT volume fractions.Nevertheless, for BSA, the capacity per mL of column is better than that reported in[22Fargues, C.; Bailly, M.; Grevillot, G. Adsorption of BSA and Hemoglobin on Hydroxyapatite Support: Equilibria and Multicomponent Dynamic Adsorption.

Capacity improvements can be obtained by increasing the CHT content of the composite beads and by reducing the CHT particle size.

The results are consistent with a model that assumes a linear relationship between bed compression and relative flow velocity. Surprisingly, the packing compressibility is essentially independent of column diameter for the preparative columns. As a result, after accounting for the variation in extraparticle porosity caused by compression, the column pressure drop is accurately predictable using the Carman\u2013Kozeny equation.

The ion exchange equilibrium is found to be independent of temperature. Conversely, the kinetics of ion exchange increases dramatically as the temperature is increased. Average ion exchange selectivity coefficients of 6.0\u00a0g/cm3 and 0.52 are obtained for the ion exchange of divalent and monovalent cationic lysine with hydrogen ion, respectively. Resin phase diffusivities are determined by fitting batch binary ion\u2010exchange data with a mass transfer model based on the Nernst\u2010Planck equations. As the temperature is increased from 25 to 60\u00b0C, the resin phase diffusivity increases from 0.04\u00d710\u22126 to 0.14\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm2/s for divalent lysine and from 0.16\u00d710\u22126 to 0.55\u00d710\u22126\u00a0cm2/s for monovalent lysine. The combination of temperature\u2010independent ion exchange equilibria and faster mass transfer at higher temperatures results in higher dynamic binding capacity and more efficient desorption of lysine when ion exchange is operated at an elevated temperature. This behavior is confirmed by means of column adsorption/desorption experiments whose results are found to be in agreement with a model incorporating the equilibrium and mass transfer data obtained in this work. Keywords: Ion exchange, lysine, equilibrium mass transfer, temperature effects\n\n\n\n\n Introduction Ion exchange plays a central role in the industrial production of amino acids and is especially critical in the manufacture of lysine, one of the largest industrial fermentation products 1. Amino acids are amphoteric and can be positively charged, neutral, or negatively charged depending on the solution pH. As a result, amino acids that are bound to a cation exchange resin at low pH can be desorbed by raising the pH to a value where the amino acid becomes negatively charged. For practical and economic reasons, ammonia is often used as a desorbent. Rational design and optimization of such ion exchange processes requires the knowledge of both the ion exchange equilibrium, which determines the maximum resin loading capacity, and the ion exchange kinetics, which determines the dynamic binding capacity as a function of flow rate as well as the time and amount of desorbent required for elution. As a result, a quantitative understanding of these two factors is critical. In previous work 2 3, ion exchange equilibria and kinetics were determined for lysine adsorption and desorption on the strong acid cation exchanger Dowex HCR\u2010W2. A model taking into account the speciation of lysine among its different charged forms was also developed to predict lysine adsorption over a broad range of conditions in batch and column systems. The model was further extended to simulate the cyclic adsorption/desorption of lysine in a multicolumn, simulated countercurrent system and the model results were found in excellent agreement with experimental results obtained with an eight\u2010column bench scale system 4. However, our previous work on lysine ion exchange was conducted entirely at room temperature, while industrial applications are frequently conducted at higher temperatures. This can have multiple practical benefits. For example, lysine solutions concentrated by evaporation at temperatures from 40\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C are often fed directly to ion exchange columns. Beside the practical advantage of avoiding a cooling step, operation above room temperature may also offer the advantage of faster mass transfer, thus, enhancing the process efficiency. Limited information is available on the ion exchange behavior of amino acids at higher temperatures, although 5 have shown that increasing temperature from 25\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C has minimal effects on the equilibrium adsorption capacity of phenylalanine while dramatically increasing the resin\u2010phase diffusivity, especially for more highly crosslinked resins. As a result, the dynamic binding capacity, which, in general, depends on both equilibrium and rate, can potentially be increased substantially by operating at higher temperatures. The objectives of this paper are twofold. The first is to extend our prior measurements of lysine ion exchange equilibrium and rates to higher temperatures. Ion exchange equilibrium constants and resin\u2010phase diffusivities of lysine are obtained for a typical poly(styrene\u2010divinylbenzene) cation exchanger at different temperatures. The second objective is to extend our previously developed model to predict the effect of temperature on lysine adsorption and desorption in cation exchange columns. The model is validated by comparison with experimental results obtained at the bench scale. Together, these developments provide a way of predicting process performance for lysine ion exchange processes operated at higher temperatures a well as a methodology to extend such predictions to other amino acids.  Materials and Methods The resin used in this work is DIAION SK\u20101B (Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan), a typical gel\u2010type poly(styrene\u2010divinylbenzene) cation exchanger with a nominal DVB content of 8% and sulfonic acid functional groups. The mean particle diameter of the hydrogen form resin is 530\u00a0\u00b5m as determined from microphotographs. The dry weight of the resin in H\u2010form is 0.465\u00a0g dry/g of hydrated particles, while the density of the resin beads in hydrogen form is 0.493\u00a0g dry/cm3. The total ion exchange capacity of the resin is 4.9\u00b10.1 mequiv/g dry H\u2010form resin (\u223c2.3 mequiv/cm3\u2010hydrated resin). This value was estimated from the adsorption capacity of monovalent lysine and is in agreement with the specifications of the resin manufacturer. l\u2010lysine was obtained from Ajinomoto Co., Inc. (Raleigh, NC). Ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride were from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Ion dissociation equilibria for lysine at different temperatures and ionic strengths were determined from potentiometric titrations as described by 6. Ion exchange equilibria were determined by a batch method as described in 2. Briefly, solutions containing lysine and ammonia were prepared with constant concentrations of chloride ion using stock solutions of lysine hydrochloride, ammonium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Aliquots of these solutions (10\u00a0cm3) were then added to test tubes containing various amounts of wet H\u2010form resin. The tubes were rotated for 4 hours, which was sufficient to reach equilibrium as indicated by batch experiments where the solution concentrations were monitored as a function of time. Temperatures were set at 25\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C with a thermostatic water bath. The amount of lysine adsorbed by the resin was calculated from the residual composition of the solution phase using a material balance. HPLC was used to determine the concentrations of ammonia and lysine using a DKK\u2010TOA Co. (Tokyo, Japan) PCI\u2010322 column (4.6\u00a0mm I.D.\u00d7250\u00a0mm) using a 6\u00a0mM aqueous solution of methanesulfonic acid (Wako Junyaku Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) as the mobile phase and detection with a Model ICA\u20102000 conductivity detector from DKK\u2010TOA Co. (Tokyo, Japan). The injection sample size was 50\u00a0\u00b5l. Ion exchange rates were measured in a 100\u00a0cm3 thermostatted glass vessel at 25\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C as discussed in 2. The vessel is agitated at 300\u00a0rpm with a magnetically driven Teflon impeller, which rests on the vessel's conical bottom preventing damage to the particles while ensuring their complete suspension and mixing of the solution. Samples of solutions containing a selected counterion were added to the vessel and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. Resin samples were then quickly added and the course of the exchange process monitored by taking 0.5\u00a0cm3 samples and analyzing them by HPLC, as described previously. Ammonium/hydrogen ion exchange kinetics experiments were also followed by continuously monitoring the electrical conductivity of the solution using a Model CM\u201030G conductivity meter from DKK\u2010TOA Co. (Tokyo, Japan) with a probe dipped in the agitated vessel. Column experiments were conducted with jacketed glass chromatography columns 2.6\u00a0cm in diameter and 5\u00a0cm in length (Model XK\u201026, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) packed with a 50% slurry of the resin followed by flow packing. The packed bed density of these columns was 0.49\u00b10.02\u00a0g dry resin/cm3, determined by emptying a packed column and weighing the oven\u2010dried resin. The void fraction was 0.34\u00b10.01, based on pulse injections of blue dextran (MW >2,000,000) detected at 280\u00a0nm with a Model L\u20104000H ultraviolet (UV) chromatographic detector from HITACH (Tokyo, Japan). Solutions containing 0.2\u00a0M lysine with sulphate concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4\u00a0M were used as the feed and 1\u00a0M ammonium hydroxide as the desorbent, pumped to the column with a HITACHI Model L\u20106320 intelligent pump. The effluent pH was monitored with a Model HM\u201030G pH meter and a Model GSF\u20105720G flow\u2010through electrode, both from DKK\u2010TOA Co. (Tokyo, Japan). The lysine composition was determined by collecting samples with an ADVANTEC Model CHF122SB fraction collector and analyzing them by HPLC as described previously.  Theory  Ion Exchange Equilibria As shown in our prior work 2\u20134, uptake of lysine by cation exchange resins, in general, results from the simultaneous exchange of monovalent and divalent lysine cations. Thus, both solution dissociation and ion exchange equilibria have to be considered. Lysine dissociates in solution according to:    where:    are the apparent dissociation constants. In our case, we consider a system that along with lysine also contains ammonia with chloride and sulfate as co\u2010ions. Two additional dissociations need to be considered:    with:     In principle, dissociation of H2SO4 into HSO4 \u2212 could also be considered. In practice, however, the concentration of undissociated H2SO4 is negligible except at very high concentrations, which are beyond the scope if this work. In general, these constants are related to the corresponding thermodynamic, infinite dilution values, K  i   T , by    where the \u03b3 i 's are activity coefficients. The latter are functions of ionic strength, I, and can be expressed using the Davies equation 7. Accordingly    where z  i  is the ion charge. A is the Debye\u2010H\u00fcckel parameter 8, and can be estimated from    where \u03c1 W  and \u03f5 are the density [g/cm3] and dielectric constant of water, respectively. The latter is expressed as a function of temperature by the equation 9    while \u03c1 W  is readily available in standard handbooks. Finally, the parameter b in Eq. (14) was taken to be 0.1 as suggested by 7). Combining Eqs. (4\u20136), (11\u201313) and 14 yields the following relationships:     The pK  i   T  values of lysine were determined by 6 and depend on temperature according to the equation:    with the values of \u0394H  T,i  0 and d  i  summarized in Table 1.

(20) and pK\u2010values at different temperatures \nDownload CSVDisplay Table In general, ion exchange equilibria can be described by the mass action law, using empirically determined equilibrium constants 11. For our system we have:     where the q  i 's are the resin\u2010phase concentrations. Assuming complete exclusion of the co\u2010ions, these concentrations are subject to the electroneutrality condition:     Given the concentrations of total lysine (C  L =C  Lys  2++C  Lys  ++C  Lys  \u00b1+ C  Lys  \u2212), total ammonia (C  N =C  NH  3+C  NH  4 +), chloride (C  Cl  \u2212), and total sulfate (C  s =C  SO  4 2\u2212+C  HSO  4 \u2212, calculation of the resin composition from Eqs. (21\u201323) requires the concentrations of the individual ionic species. This is done by first calculating the solution pH by imposing the electroneutrality condition:     combined with Eq (17\u201319) and the relationship K  W =C  H  + C  OH  \u2212, this equation can be solved numerically for C  H  + from which pH=\u2212log(\u03b3 H  + C  H  +). The concentrations of the individual ionic species can then be calculated from Eqs. (4\u20136) and 9\u201310. The values of pK  W , pK  N , and pK  S2 needed for these calculations were obtained from the literature as summarized in Table 1. The ion exchange equilibrium constants were determined by fitting the equilibrium model to the experimental data for the NH4 +/H+, Lys+/NH4 + and Lys2+/H+ exchanges. The Lys+/NH4 + equilibrium constant was converted into Lys+/H+ equilibrium constant dividing it by the NH4 +/H+ equilibrium constant.   Ion Exchange Kinetics The kinetics of ion exchange of amino acids is generally controlled by diffusion in the resin phase 11\u201314. This is also the case for lysine owing to its relatively bulky side chain 2. Batch adsorption experiments were thus used to determine the relevant diffusion coefficients at different temperatures. Diffusional mass transfer within ion exchange particles can be described in terms of the Nernst\u2010Planck equations. The complete set of equations is given in 2 and only a brief summary is presented here. The following equations and boundary conditions are written: For the resin beads     For the solution    where q  L =q  Lys  ++q  Lys  2+ and q  N = q  NH  4 ++q  NH  3. In these equations, r  p  is the particle radius, q  i * is the equilibrium resin composition, q  i  0 is the initial resin composition, M  r  is the mass of resin, V is the solution volume, and C  L  0 and C  N  0 are the initial lysine and ammonia solution concentrations, respectively. Equations (31\u201333) are obtained from material balances relating the concentrations averaged over the particle volume, q\u00af, to the mass transfer fluxes at the particle surface. The fluxes are given by 14:    where z  i  is the ion charge and, M is the number of counterions and    where D  i  is the resin phase diffusivity of ion i, D  M  is the diffusivity of a reference ion, H+, in our case. In addition to these equations the following relationship also exist between monovalent and divalent forms of lysine and free ammonia and ammonium ion:    where K 1  R =K 1(K  Lys  +, H  +/K  Lys  2+,  H  +) and K  N  R=K  N  (K  p /K H +  NH 4 + ) are the resin\u2010phase dissociation constants for divalent lysine and ammonium ion, respectively. K  p  is the partition coefficient for free ammonia (NH3) in the resin. The value K  p =0.68\u00b10.01 as determined by 13. The resulting equations were solved numerically as discussed in 2.   Prediction of Column Behavior The behavior of a resin column can be predicted starting with the following material balances:    where u is the superficial velocity, \u03c1 b  is the bed resin density, \u03f5 is the void fraction, and superscript F and 0 refer to feed and initial conditions, respectively. These equations assume plug flow and neglect axial dispersion, which is appropriate for preparative\u2010scale resins where band broadening is controlled by intraparticle diffusion. In principle, these equations can be combined with Eqs. (27\u201327) and (34\u201336). In practice, however, sufficient accuracy is obtained with a simplified description in terms of the film model approximation of 15. The following rate equations are obtained 3:    where the overbar represents the average resin composition. The parameter m is determined by solving the equation 4:    These equations are solved numerically with backwards discretization of the spatial derivative using 10 finite difference points 3.   Results  Ion Exchange Equilibria Ion exchange equilibrium data were obtained for the binaries NH4 +/H+, Lys2+/H+, and Lys+/NH4 + and are shown in Figs. 1\u20133. For each binary the temperature dependence of the ion exchange equilibrium appears to be insignificant. Thus the equilibrium constants K  NH  4 +, H  +, K  Lys  2+, H  +, K  Lys  +, NH  4 +, are invariant with temperature and were determined by fitting Eq. (21\u201323) to the data. The resulting values are summarized in Table 2. For the NH4 +/H+ and Lys2+/H+ exchange equilbria, concentration\u2010independent values of K  NH  4 +, H  +, and K  Lys  2+, H  +, provide good fits of the data (see Fig. 1 and 2). However, this is not the case for the Lys+/NH4 + equilibrium. For this exchange, following 2 we use a heterogeneous ion exchange model assuming that exchange occurs on two types of functional groups. Accordingly, for each functional group we have:     subject to the constraint:     where K d  i,H  + is equilibrium constant for exchange of ion i and H + on group j, z  i  is the charge of ion I, and p  j  is the fraction of groups that are of type j. The average equilibrium constant K\u00af i,H  +is related to the values for each group type through the following equation 16:     Lysine Adsorption on Cation Exchange Resin. IV.

The equilibrium constants determined in this work for the DIAION SK1B resin are compared with the values previously reported by 2 for Dowex HCR\u2010W2 in Table 2. Both resins are nominally 8% crosslinked. K\u2010values are the same for the ammonium\u2010hydrogen ion exchange, but they are similar for the divalent lysine\u2010hydrogen and monovalent lysine\u2010hydrogen exchanges indicating that the two resins are comparable.   Resin Phase Diffusivities Batch ion exchange kinetics data were obtained for the binaries NH4 +/H+, Lys2+/H+, and Lys+/NH4 +. Representative results obtained at 25 and 60\u00b0C with different amounts of resin are shown in Figs. 4\u20136. Results at 40\u00b0C were intermediate (data not shown). It can be seen that the kinetics is fastest for the NH4 +/H+ exchange and slowest for the Lys2+/H+ exchange. In all three cases, however, the kinetics is improved dramatically by increasing the temperature from 25 to 60\u00b0C. As discussed in the Theory section, the mass transfer fluxes are electrically coupled. Thus, individual ion diffusivities were determined by fitting model calculations based on Eq. (26\u201336) to the data with the following methodology. The diffusivity of hydrogen ion in 8% crosslinked resins, D  H  +, is available at 25\u00b0C 17.Thus, D  NH  4 + can be obtained at this temperature by fitting the model to the data in Fig. 4a. For the other temperatures, we assumed that the ratio D  NH  4 +/D  H  + remains constant. This assumption is valid for diffusion in the liquid phase 18 and is likely to apply to the resin phase as well. Next we determined the divalent and monovalent lysine diffusivities from the data in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively, using the D  NH  4 + \u2010value determined at each temperature. Here both D  Lys  2+ and D  Lys  + are so small that the much larger hydrogen ion diffusivity plays almost no role in the overall kinetics. Thus, for these conditions, mass transfer is largely controlled by D  Lys  2+ and D  Lys  +. As a result these values can be determined accurately from the data in Figs. 5 and 6.

A summary of the diffusivity values is given in Table 3. Diffusivities of all species increase dramatically as the temperature is increased. This behavior is compared with the results for phenylalanine of 5 and with the diffusivities in the solution phase predicted by using Wilke\u2010Chang equation 18 in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the effect of the temperature on the resin\u2010phase diffusivity for both mono\u2010 and divalent lysine cations is similar to that of phenylalanine cations and is much more pronounced than the effect predicted for the solution phase. Thus, increasing the temperature enhances the ion exchange kinetics much more than could be expected for transport in free solution. The monovalent lysine diffusivity is larger than that of phenylalanine, likely because of the bulkier hydrophobic side chain of the latter amino acid. Finally, divalent lysine cations have even lower resin phase diffusivity. This trend is also seen when comparing monovalent and divalent inorganic cations and is likely a result of the stronger interaction of divalent cations with the resin's charged groups.

In both cases, desorption was with 1.0\u00a0M ammonium hydroxide. The first case, Fig. 8, corresponds to conditions where lysine is predominately in monovalent form during the adsorption step, since the pH is relatively high. For these conditions, lysine adsorption is thermodynamically unfavorable (see Fig. 2) and the breakthrough curve follows a gradual wave pattern. In this case, temperature has a small effect since band broadening is dominated by the unfavorable nature of the Lys+/NH4 + exchange. The effect of temperature is however much more pronounced for the desorption step. In 1.0\u00a0M ammonium hydroxide, the lysine is completely deprotonated and carries a negative charge. As a result it is completely excluded from the resin making the desorption process entirely diffusion controlled. As seen by comparing Figs. 8c and d, the tailing of the lysine desorption curve is greatly reduced at 60\u00b0C, resulting in a more efficient process. Correspondingly the height of the desorption peak is increased. Intermediate results were obtained at 40\u00b0C (data not shown). Model predictions, based on the equilibrium constants and diffusivities determined in this work are also shown in Figs. 8 and 9 and are in excellent agreement with the experimental results.

The results shown in Fig. 9 are for conditions where the lysine is predominately in divalent form during the adsorption step because of the relatively low pH. In this case, the breakthrough curve follows a shock pattern and band broadening is controlled by mass transfer. As seen in Figs. 9a and b, the position of the breakthrough patterns does not change with temperature, since the uptake equilibrium is invariant. However, the curve becomes significantly sharper as a results of the higher resin phase diffusivity when the temperature is increased from 25 to 60\u00b0C. Substantial improvements are also seen for the desorption curves (Figs. 9c and d) with significant reduction in tailing and higher peak concentrations when the temperature is increased from 25 to 60\u00b0C. Intermediate results were found at 40\u00b0C (data not shown). As for the intermediate pH cases, model predictions are also in excellent agreement with the data supporting the validity of the model and the experimental determinations of ion exchange equilibrium constants and diffusivities.   Conclusions Ion exchange equilibrium and kinetics were determined for lysine adsorption on a cation exchange resin at temperatures of 25, 40, and 60\u00b0C. Increasing temperature was found to have insignificant effects on ion exchange equilibrium but to enhance dramatically the exchange kinetics. A model taking into account the solution equilibrium was used to determine the ion exchange equilibrium constants for ammonium ion and for monovalent and divalent lysine. These constants are essentially independent of temperature. Resin phase diffusivities were found by fitting batch ion exchange data and exhibit an Arrenhius\u2010type dependence on temperature with an activation energy about twice as large as that predicted for diffusion in free solution. Finally, the modeling approach and the physical constants obtained in this work were validated by comparing experimental column adsorption and desorption results with predictions based on a model incorporating solution and ion exchange equilbria and diffusional mass transfer kinetics. Excellent agreement between model and data supports the validity of the overall approach. An important conclusion is based on the result that the lysine adsorption capacity does not change with temperature while the resin phase diffusivities increase dramatically as the temperature is increased from 25 to 60\u00b0C. This behavior can be exploited in a process to increase the dynamic binding capacity and the concentration of the desorbed product while reducing the consumption of the desorbent as a result of the much less pronounced tailing obtained at higher temperatures.

One of the reactants is assumed to be preferentially adsorbed with a favorable isotherm, while the other is adsorbed with a linear isotherm. The reaction follows an arbitrary kinetics where the rate is dependent on the concentrations of A and B. An analytic solution based on the method of characteristics is obtained for the case of local adsorption equilibrium. The dynamic behavior is affected by an intimate coupling of reaction kinetics and adsorption and breakthrough of the favorably adsorbed species is delayed by the occurrence of the reaction. The theoretical analysis is compared to experimental results obtained for an immobilized-enzyme reactor system for the esterification of propionic acid and isoamyl alcohol in hexane. The local adsorption equilibrium solution obtained for this system is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. Quantitative agreement is obtained taking into account numerically the finite rate of adsorption and axial dispersion.

A brief overview of critical problems and research opportunities is presented. This is then followed by the analysis of a case study involving the recovery and separation of amino acids by ion exchange. Experimental methodologies and modeling approaches that we have adopted in the study of these processes are reviewed.KeywordsNeutral Amino AcidCation Exchange ResinAmino Acid CationDisplacement StepMass Transfer ParameterThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Comparative chromatographic separation studies have also been conducted for the system using a conventional fixed-bed column packed with the same resin. Complete resolution of fructose-glucose mixtures could be obtained both in a 60 cm-long continuous annular chromatograph and in a conventional column of the same length with sugars feed concentration up to 200 g/L. In the four-component mixture blue dextran (higher molecular weight saccharide), sucrose, glucose and fructose complete rsolution of all species except sucrose-glucose under the relatively mild separating conditions tested. The experimental results have been analyzed in terms of approximate linear chromatographic theories for fixed and rotating beds. Bed properties and equilibrium and mass transfer parameters used in the model were obtained through independent experiments. With these parameters a good fit to the experimental results was obtained. Differences in feed mixtures and dispersion characteristics contribute to the minor offset between fixed bed and continuous chromatograph results. 21 refs., 12 figs., 3 tabs.\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\nHoward, A J; \nCarta, G; \nByers, C H\n\n\n\nPublication Date: \n1987-01-01\n\n\nResearch Org.: \nOak Ridge National Lab., TN (USA); Virginia Univ., Charlottesville (USA).

Complete resolution of fructose-glucose mixtures could be obtained both in a 60-cm-long CAC and in a conventional column of the same length with a sugar feed concentration of up to 200 g/L. Partial resolution of sucrose in three component mixtures was also obtained, and the three sugars were completely separated from added higher-molecular-weight saccharides. Results have been analyzed in terms of approximatemore\u00a0\u00bb linear chromatographic theories and orthogonal collocation of exact mass transfer model equations for fixed and rotating beds. A systematic, comparative evaluation of factors affecting process performance and design procedures is presented.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSugar separations on a pilot scale by continuous annular chromatography\n\nJournal Article\nByers, C; Sisson, W; DeCarli, II, J; ... \nA pilot-scale continuous annular chromatography has been developed for scale-up and optimization studies. The chromatographic apparatus consists of a slowly rotating annular bed of sorbent material. The feed mixture which is to be separated is continuously introduced at a stationary point at the top of the bed, while eluent flows over the remainder of the annulus. The rotation of the sorbend bed coupled with the elution development induced by the downflow of eluent causes the feed components to appear as individual helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point. The separation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, usingmore\u00a0\u00bb the calcium form of a cation-exchange resin, was investigated using water as the eluent. Experiments were carried out both with a synthetic mixture of the sugars as well as with an industrial feedstock. The separation was explored first in a bench-scale conventional fixed-bed column and then in the pilot-scale continuous chromatography. Factors such as column loading, feed-to-eluent ratio, and feed concentration were investigated both experimentally an theoretically. The results of bench-sale experiments were carried out in the limit of infinite dilution, almost perfectly scaled to the pilot unit when loading was low and feed mixtures were of low viscosity. Very significant deviations from ideality were, however, observed at high feed loadings, when the feed viscosity exceeded that of the eluent by more than a factor of 2.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/bp00001a003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous separation of carbohydrates by ion-exchange chromatography\n\nJournal Article\nWolfgang, J; Prior, A; Bart, H; ...  - Separation Science and Technology\n\nA synthetic mixture of fructose, mannitol and sorbitol was continuously separated by a chromatographic method using a cation-exchange resin (Dowex 50W-X8) in its Ca{sup 2+}-form as the stationary phase. An annular chromatograph (AC) was used to achieve a continuous mode of operation. Distribution and mass transfer coefficients of the three substances as well as bed properties were obtained by batch chromatography. The separation was simulated mathematically in terms of an approximate linear chromatographic theory was applied to the modeling of the behavior of the continuous separations. The influence of rotation rate, column loading, eluent flow rate and feed concentration onmore\u00a0\u00bb the resolution of the individual peaks were investigated.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/01496399708003187\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-capacity pressurized continuous chromatograph\n\nJournal Article\nBegovich, J; Byers, C; Sisson, W - Sep. Sci. Technol.; (United States)\n\nMulticomponent liquid chromatographic separations have been achieved by using a slowly rotating annular bed of sorbent material. The feed material is continuously introduced at a stationary point at the top of the bed, and eluent is allowed to flow everywhere else around the annulus. The rotation of the sorbent bed causes the separated components to appear as helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point; hence the separation process is truly continuous. The concept has been developed primarily on a 279-mm-diam by 0.6-m-long device with a 12.7-mm-wide annulus. The effects of annulus width and diameter have beenmore\u00a0\u00bb studied using the same device with annulus widths up to 114.3 mm. With this largest width, approximately 96% of the area available within the outer cylinder is devoted to the rotating sorbent bed. Further annulus-width studies have been pursued on units with 89- and 445-mm diameters. These geometric extensions to the basic concept allow extremely large capacity increases with minimal loss in separation and no increase in chromatograph diameter. The effects associated with increased feed concentration have also been studied. In this effort as well as in the annulus-width program, the separation of copper, nickel, and cobalt components from a carbonate solution was studied in detail. The nickel and cobalt components are found in the leach liquor of the Caron process for recovering nickel and cobalt from laterite ores. Nominally 50-..mu..m-diam Dowex 50W-X8 cation exchange resin was used as the bed material. The nickel concentration of the feed was varied tenfold, from 136.1 to approximately 1400 meq/L. The combined effects of the bed loading and annulus width were studied and compared with nonlinear theory. 17 references, 9 figures, 1 table.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/01496398308059923\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-capacity pressurized continuous chromatograph\n\nConference\nBegovich, J; Byers, C; Sisson, W\n\nMulticomponent liquid chromatographic separations have been achieved by using a slowly rotating annular bed of sorbent material.

The two components are assumed to have the same binding capacity without the possibility of displacement of one component by the other but with different effective pore diffusivities. As a result, the amounts of each component adsorbed depend on the relative rates of mass transfer within the particles. Closed-form analytical expressions derived by solving the relevant conservation equations are obtained to describe adsorption from an infinite bath with constant concentrations at the particle surface, batch adsorption in a finite bath, and adsorption in packed columns, both under constant pattern and non-constant pattern conditions. In each case, the expression derived reduces to a single integral. These expressions are in good agreement with the numerical solutions of the corresponding general rate model for conditions where the kinetics of binding is fast and provide a simple means to predict two-component adsorption in many practical cases where strong adsorption conditions prevail. Generalizations to systems with more than two components, to cases where the external mass transfer resistance is important, and to unequal capacities are also provided.Navigate LeftPrevious article in issueNext article in issueNavigate RightKeywordsIrreversible multicomponent adsorptionPore diffusionMass transfer modelingColumn breakthroughRecommended articlesCited by (0)\u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The prestress in that segment may be due to some distortion forces acting upon the bar. The end surfaces of the segment act as discontinuity surfaces inside the medium. They partially reflect and partially transmit any pressure wave impinging on them. It is found that the coefficients of reflection and transmission are functions both of the prestress of the segment and of the frequency of the wave. This produces a prestress-induced dispersion-like phenomenon, which in principle should be capable of revealing the state of internal stress of the body.\n\n\n\nAccess provided by Gordon Library, WPI\n\nDownload to read the full article text\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferencesShen, F., Li, Q., Li, S.: Effects of stress and saturating fluids on wave propagation in porous-fractured rocks.

DIMON SK-1B was used as an example of cation exchange resin, which has 8% of DVB content. L-lysine dissociation constants, ion exchange equilibrium constants and intraparticle diffusivities were measured at 25 degrees C. These fundamental parameters were applied for multicolumn simulation. All calculated results were obtained for a column of 1.5 cm phi X 10 cm and switching time of 3600 s. 1. In the case of single-column adsorption, L-lysine leakage in the adsorption train was observed at a feed rate of 5.7X 10(-2) mol/h of L-lysine when monovalent lysine solution was fed to the multicolumn system. Two-and three-column adsorption systems showed L-lysine leakage at feed rates of 1.2x10(-1) mol/h and 1.4 X 10(-1) mol/h of L-lysine, respectively. Thus, the increase of column number from 1 to 2 was effective for prevention of the leakage, while the increase of column number from 2 to 3 was not effective. 2. In the case of single-column elution, L-lysine was not completely desorbed at any feed rate of ammonia into the system. Two- and three-column desorption systems showed similar results, with complete L-lysine desorption at feed rates of 6.6X 10-2 mol/h and 1.0X 10(-1) mol/h of ammonia, respectively.\n\n\nKeywords:L-lysme;ion exchange;multicolumn system;intraparticle diffusivity;simulation\n\n   \n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\uc774\uc6a9\uc57d\uad00 | \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ucde8\uae09\ubc29\uce68 | \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ubb34\ub2e8\uc218\uc9d1\uac70\ubd80\n\n\ubcf8 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub294 \uc800\uc791\uad8c\ubc95\uc758 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ubc1b\ub294\ubc14, \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc804\uc7ac, \ubcf5\uc0ac, \ubc30\ud3ec \ub4f1\uc744 \uae08\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\u00a9 Copyright 1995 - 2022 CHERIC.

        "Preparative Separations of Acidic Protein Mixtures and Protein Charge Variants by Chromatofocusing with Unretained Buffers": "  \nPreparative Separations of Acidic Protein Mixtures and Protein Charge Variants by Chromatofocusing with Unretained Buffers  - 2:30 PM312gPreparative Separations of Acidic Protein Mixtures and Protein Charge Variants by Chromatofocusing with Unretained Buffers\nTimothy M. Pabst, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904, Giorgio Carta, Department Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4741, Alan K. Hunter, Global Biologics, Pfizer, 700 Chesterfield Parkway West, Chesterfield, MO 63017, and Natarajan Ramasubramanyan, Global Biologics, PGRD, Pfizer Inc, 700 Chesterfield Pkwy West, Chesterfield, MO 63005. \nComplex pH transitions occur in exchange columns containing weak acid or weak base during salt steps or gradients if the mobile phase is buffered and the buffering species do not interact with the stationary phase. If not anticipated and planned for within a separation step, they can result in large equilibration volumes and potentially negative effects on pH-sensitive proteins. On the other hand, such pH variations, if controlled and directed, can be beneficial to the separation of proteins. The behavior of chromatographic columns packed with resins containing both weak cation exchange and weak anion exchange groups is investigated in order to obtain protein separations by means of internally generated pH gradients in response to step changes in buffer composition. A local equilibrium model is developed to predict pH transitions using non-adsorbed buffers, i.e. containing neutral or anionic buffering species with cation exchangers and neutral or cationic buffering species with anion exchangers. In agreement with experimental results, the model, based exclusively on the resins' titration curves, predicts practical, fairly linear gradients, which are formed using suitable mixtures of acidic buffers for cation exchange and basic buffers for anion exchange. The separation of mixtures of ovalbumin, albumin, and transferrin is used as a model system with cation exchange columns while the separations of transferrin and of mAb charge variants are used as model systems with anion exchange columns. The peaks obtained with this approach are much sharper than could be obtained isocratically or using externally generated, unretained gradients as a result of the peak compression caused by the axial pH gradient formed along the column. Moreover, separation is obtained at very low ionic strengths (2-3 mS/cm). The effects of flow velocity, mobile phase composition, time of injection, and protein load on retention and elution pH are investigated systematically demonstrating a range of ways in which the separation can be controlled and optimized. \n \n  See more of #312 - Plenary Session II on Bioseparations: Novel Approaches to Bioseparations (02G02)\n  See more of Separations DivisionSee more of  The 2008 Annual Meeting\n\n\n",

Pabst, Ernie X. Perez-Almodovar, and Giorgio Carta. Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904\nIn this work we analyze the effects of the weak acid content of macroporous cation exchange resins based on acrylamido and vinyl polymers that contain different amounts of weak acid groups in addition to their main sulphopropyl cation exchange functionality. UNOsphere S and Rapid S resins from Bio-Rad Laboratories are used for this comparison. When operated at pH values below 7, the presence of weak acid groups in UNOsphere S results in substantial pH transients, which are induced by changes in salt concentration, even though the mobile phase is buffered. These transients are greatly reduced with UNOsphere Rapid S, which contains a much lower concentration of weak acid groups, permitting very rapid requilibration and avoiding any significant change in pH during protein elution with salt. Protein adsorption equilibrium and mass transfer rates were also studied for both materials using several proteins with molecular masses between 15 and 150 kDa. Despite its much lower concentration of weak acid groups, UNOsphere Rapid S exhibits protein adsorption capacities and effective pore diffusivities that are essentially the same as those observed for UNOsphere S. These results suggest that the weak acid groups in UNOsphere S are primarily associated with the polymer backbone structure and do not interact directly with proteins molecules.\n \n  See more of #364 - New and Improved Chromatographic Resins and Processes for Bioseparations (02G03)\n  See more of Separations DivisionSee more of  The 2008 Annual Meeting\n\n\n",

Stone, David M. Schlientz, and Giorgio Carta. Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, 102 Engineers' Way, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4741\nWe have recently developed a new method to image transient patterns of protein adsorption in individual spherical chromatographic particles under strong binding conditions. The method takes advantage of the difference in refractive index between the protein-free and protein-saturated adsorbent matrix. When the particles are viewed with an ordinary microscope using white light illumination, the adsorption front appears as a bright ring that moves in time from the surface of the particle to its center. Experimental data were previously obtained for a limited number of proteins with the cation exchanger SP-Sepharose-FF. Sharp rings were observed confirming that protein mass transfer within the particles occurs via a shell-progressive diffusion mechanism. Quantitative analysis based on the shrinking core model provided an accurate and precise way of determining the intraparticle diffusivity for individual particles. In this work we extend these measurements to investigate (a) the effect of ionic strength on protein adsorption in IEX resins, (b) the adsorption of different proteins in agarose-based HIC resins, and (c) the adsorption of IgG in Protein A adsorbents. \n \n  See more of #292 - Experimental Methods in Adsorption (02E06)\n  See more of Separations DivisionSee more of  The 2007 Annual Meeting\n\n\n",

These isoforms are best understood by evaluating their biological activity using bioassays that measure their biochemical or biological function.  Availability of preparative amounts of these variants is essential for these assays.  Many of the analytical techniques that are capable of separating these isoforms either do not provide material that can used readily or are not amenable to fractionation or scale-up.   In this study we report successful separation and/or enrichment of protein isoforms that arise due to differences in aggregation and sialation using preparative, high resolution pH based separation methods.  Shallow gradients of over 20 column volumes over one pH unit provide a high resolution power, even under relatively high loads (2-5 mg/ml resin).  Representative data from a couple of representative protein molecules that have been successfully separated using these techniques is presented. \n \n  See more of #209 - Adsorption of Biomolecules (02E11)\n  See more of Separations DivisionSee more of  The 2007 Annual Meeting\n\n\n",

Belcher, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4741 and Giorgio Carta, Department Chemical  Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4741. \nUnderstanding protein transport in ion exchange matrices is essential for the rational design of improved stationary phases and for the development of models to describe rate processes in chromatography columns.  Macroscopic measurements of mass transfer rates can provide quantitative information about transport behavior. However, such measurements are subject to multiple mechanistic interpretations since different models often result in qualitatively similar macroscopic behavior.  On the other hand, the measurement of concentration profiles within stationary phases at the microscopic level is thought to provide greater insight in the nature of the transport mechanism. In the past, such measurements have been conducted for charged polyacrylamide gels supported within thin capillaries and for spherical ion exchange particles by confocal microscopy using fluorescently labeled proteins. In this work, we extend the visualization of concentration profiles to charged agarose gels supported in microfluidics chips using optical microscopy with chromatophoric proteins.  In order to directly view concentration profiles during transient adsorption and desorption, thin (100 um) slabs of anionic agarose gels are synthesized on etched glass microfluidics chips. A protein solution flows past the exposed edge of the gel slab and a microscope with CCD camera is used to monitor the evolution of concentration profiles in the slab. The latter is converted to protein concentration using a calibration curve. We have studied the behavior of three proteins, cytochrome c, myoglobin, and hemoglobin.  Because of the rectilinear, semi-infinite geometry, boundary effects are de-emphasized compared to the case of spherical particles and a simple mathematical treatment can be used to determine the protein diffusivity in the gel as a function of protein concentration. The effects of solution protein concentration, ionic strength, and flow rate have been measured for different proteins. For comparison purposes, agarose spheres are also prepared allowing conventional macroscopic measurement of adsorption isotherms and uptake rate. Microscopic and macroscopic measurements are then compared with different mass transfer models. Agreement between these measurements suggests that fundamental data obtained at the microscopic level can be used to predict the macroscopic behavior of practical stationary phases.\n \n  See more of #443 - Experimental Methods in Adsorption (02E09)\n  See more of Separations DivisionSee more of  The 2006 Annual Meeting\n\n\n",

        "Theory and Practice in Bioseparation Engineering": "\nTheory and Practice in Bioseparation Engineering Tuesday,  1 November 2005 - 1:30 PM237dTheory and Practice in Bioseparation Engineering\nGiorgio Carta and Donald J. Kirwan. Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4741\nWe describe a new undergraduate course in bioseparation engineering. The course is taught as a part of our concentration in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering, which has been designed to prepare chemical engineering graduates for careers with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and for further graduate work in these areas. The concentration includes the three required courses: Introduction to Biotechnology, Biochemical Engineering, Bioseparation Engineering as well as two elective bioscience courses. The bioseparation engineering course covers specialized unit operations that are not normally covered in regular chemical engineering courses, including sedimentation and centrifugation, membrane-based separations, adsorption and chromatography, precipitation, and crystallization. After a brief summary of the molecular properties of typical biomolecules, these operations are introduced in the order they typically would be conducted downstream of the initial manufacture of biotechnology products. Ancillary operations such as sterile processing, clean-in-place and regulatory aspects are briefly covered. In order to provide a practical exposure to bioseparations, the course also includes an experimental component where students, divided in teams, conduct and analyze experiments in membrane ultrafiltration and chromatography. The experiments are conducted focusing on engineering measurements of physical parameters needed for scale-up and design of processing units, much as they would be conducted in an industrial process development setting. Thus, each experiment also involves a design component where the students are asked to design a scaled-up process based on their experimental measurements. Spreadsheet-based analysis and simulation tools are provided to the students to aid in the various analysis and design tasks. The hands-on approach and the ability to examine real data illustrate the advantages and pitfalls of theory and provide a greater conceptual understanding of separation processes for biological molecules.\n \n  See more of #237 - Teaching Alternate Separation Technologies (04005)\n  \n  See more of Education\n  See more of  The 2005 Annual Meeting (Cincinnati, OH)\n",
        "Protein Adsorption Kinetics Measurements with Radioactive Tracers": "\nProtein Adsorption Kinetics Measurements with Radioactive Tracers Tuesday,  1 November 2005 - 10:05 AM163fProtein Adsorption Kinetics Measurements with Radioactive Tracers\nGiorgio Carta and Antonio Ubiera. University of Virginia, Department of Chemical Engineering, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4741\nThe determination of the rates and mechanisms of protein mass transfer in adsorbent particles is important as mass transfer is typically the determining factor in column efficiency, especially at the process scale. Considerable advances in our understanding of protein adsorption kinetics have been made in recent years by means of microscopy techniques, which allow a visualization of protein concentration profiles in the adsorbent using either colored or fuorescently labeled proteins. However, a complementary technique is based on the use of radioactive tracers. With such tracers measurements can be conducted with optically opaque particles and mass transfer rates can be determined directly. Moreover mass transfer kinetics can be determined readily under both gradient and tracer diffusion conditions. In this work we have used I125 labeled lysozyme and ?-chymotrypsinogen to determine the adsorption kinetics in three different cation exchangers: SP-Sepharose-FF, SP-Sepharose-XL, and S-HyperD. The radiolabeled proteins were found to be stable and indistinguishable from the unlabeled proteins in high-resolution gradient elution cation exchange chromatography. Measurements of adsorption kinetics were conducted with a shallow-bed placed directly in the lead-shielded chamber of a radioactivity detector. With this arrangement protein uptake and desorption curves are obtained directly at a constant protein concentration by following the bed radioactivity as a function of time. Very different mass transfer rates were obtained for the three different adsorbents considered in this work. Moreover there was a profound difference in the dependence of the rate on salt concentration. A comparison of gradient and tracer diffusion kinetics is especially interesting. In gradient diffusion experiments, initially clean particles are exposed to a protein solution containing the radioactive tracer. Conversely, in tracer diffusion experiments, particles initially saturated with the unlabeled protein are exposed to a protein solution containing the radioactive tracer. In the first case mass transfer is potentially affected by electrokinetic contributions, while in the second case, mass transfer should be determined by diffusion alone. Further, comparison of these measurements can provide clues regarding the diffusional mobility of these molecules in the adsorbed phase. At low ionic strengths we observed large differences between the gradient diffusion and the tracer diffusion kinetics for all three media. However, at higher ionic strengths this difference became less pronounced and disappeared altogether for SP-Sepharose-FF and SP-Sepharose-XL. The difference remained however quite pronounced for S-HyperD suggesting significant differences in the transport mechanism. Even more interesting results were obtained by comparing tracer diffusion kinetics in the opposite direction; i.e. by exposing particles presaturated with protein and radiolabeled tracer to a solution containing the unlabeled protein alone. An interpretation of these results in terms of pore size and charge of the media, and of diffusion models will be presented providing insight in the mechanism of protein transport in these high-capacity cation exchangers. \n \n  See more of #163 - Experimental Methods in Adsorption I (02E07)\n  \n  See more of Separations Division\n  See more of  The 2005 Annual Meeting (Cincinnati, OH)\n",

The uptake of these molecules by sulfonated polystyrene-DVB resins occurs via the stoichiometric exchange of amino acid cations. The overall sorption behavior is thus dependent upon ion exchange and solution equilibria, which determine the extent of ionization of the amino acids. Intraparticle transport rates are controlled by the slow diffusion of amino acid cations in the resin, and are strongly dependent upon the hydration of the resin and the size of the diffusing molecule.KeywordsAnion Exchange ResinHydration WaterAmino Acid CationMass Balance MethodDesorption ProfileThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Previous work has demonstrated the utility of this technology for the separation of various materials by isocratic elution on a bench scale. Novel applications and improved operation of the process were studied in this work, demonstrating that CAC is a versatile apparatus which is capable of separations at high throughput. Three specific separation systems were investigated. Pilot-scale separations at high loadings were performed using an industrial sugar mixture as an example of scale-up for isocratic separations. Bench-scale experiments of a low concentration metal ion mixture were performed to demonstrate stepwise elution, a chromatographic technique which decreases dilution and increases sorbent capacity. Finally, the separation of mixtures of amino acids by ion exchange was investigated to demonstrate the use of displacement development on the CAC. This technique, which perhaps has the most potential, when applied to the CAC allowed simultaneous separation and concentration of multicomponent mixtures on a continuous basis. Mathematical models were developed to describe the CAC performance and optimize the operating conditions. For all the systems investigated, the continuous separation performance of the CAC was found to be very nearly the same as the batchwisemore\u00a0\u00bb performance of conventional chromatography. The technology appears, thus, to be very promising for industrial applications.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: \n\nDeCarli, II, J P; \nCarta, G; \nByers, C H\n\n\n\nPublication Date: \n1989-10-01\n\n\nResearch Org.: \nOak Ridge National Lab., TN (United States); Virginia Univ., Charlottesville, VA (United States)\n\n\nSponsoring Org.: \nUSDOE; USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)\n\n\nOSTI Identifier: \n5912255\n\n\nReport Number(s): \nDOE/OR/21400-T468 ON: DE92002341\n\n\nDOE Contract Number: \u00a0\nAC05-84OR21400\n\n\nResource Type: \nTechnical Report\n\n\nCountry of Publication: \nUnited States\n\n\nLanguage: \nEnglish\n\n\nSubject: \n37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; AMINO ACIDS; CHROMATOGRAPHY; ION EXCHANGE MATERIALS; IONS; MASS TRANSFER; METALS; RESINS; SACCHARIDES; CARBOHYDRATES; CARBOXYLIC ACIDS; CHARGED PARTICLES; ELEMENTS; MATERIALS; ORGANIC ACIDS; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; ORGANIC POLYMERS; PETROCHEMICALS; PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; POLYMERS; SEPARATION PROCESSES; 400105* - Separation Procedures; 320303 - Energy Conservation, Consumption, & Utilization- Industrial & Agricultural Processes- Equipment & Processes\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation Formats\n\n\nMLA\nAPA\nChicago\nBibTeX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    DeCarli, II, J P, Carta, G, and Byers, C H.

Three specific separation systems were investigated. Pilot-scale separations at high loadings were performed using an industrial sugar mixture as an example of scale-up for isocratic separations. Bench-scale experiments of a low concentration metal ion mixture weremore\u00a0\u00bb performed to demonstrate stepwise elution, a chromatographic technique which decreases dilution and increases sorbent capacity. Finally, the separation of mixtures of amino acids by ion exchange was investigated to demonstrate the use of displacement development on the CAC. This technique, which perhaps has the most potential, when applied to the CAC allowed simultaneous separation and concentration of multicomponent mixtures on a continuous basis. Mathematical models were developed to describe the CAC performance and optimize the operating conditions. For all the systems investigated, the continuous separation performance of the CAC was found to be very nearly the same as the batchwise performance of conventional chromatography. the technology appears, thus, to be very promising for industrial applications. 43 figs., 9 tabs.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.2172/6951560\nFull Text Available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplacement separations by continuous annular chromatography\n\nConference\nDeCarli, II, J; Carta, G; Byers, C\n\nContinuous annular chromatography (CAC) has been introduced as an effective means of carrying out chromatographic separations in a truly continuous manner. Process applications have been demonstrated. In this work the authors demonstrate how CAC can be operated for displacement development separations. In this mode of operation of the apparatus separation and concentration of multicomponent mixtures can be obtained simultaneously and continuously.

The chromatographic apparatus consists of a slowly rotating annular bed of sorbent material. The feed mixture which is to be separated is continuously introduced at a stationary point at the top of the bed, while eluent flows over the remainder of the annulus. The rotation of the sorbend bed coupled with the elution development induced by the downflow of eluent causes the feed components to appear as individual helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point. The separation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, usingmore\u00a0\u00bb the calcium form of a cation-exchange resin, was investigated using water as the eluent. Experiments were carried out both with a synthetic mixture of the sugars as well as with an industrial feedstock. The separation was explored first in a bench-scale conventional fixed-bed column and then in the pilot-scale continuous chromatography. Factors such as column loading, feed-to-eluent ratio, and feed concentration were investigated both experimentally an theoretically. The results of bench-sale experiments were carried out in the limit of infinite dilution, almost perfectly scaled to the pilot unit when loading was low and feed mixtures were of low viscosity. Very significant deviations from ideality were, however, observed at high feed loadings, when the feed viscosity exceeded that of the eluent by more than a factor of 2.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/bp00001a003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous separation of proteins by annular chromatography\n\nJournal Article\nBloomingburg, G; Bauer, J; Carta, G; ...  - Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)\n\nIn this paper, the separation of protein mixtures by continuous annular chromatography (CAC) is studied in a preparative-scale apparatus. S-Sepharose, a strong-acid porous cation-exchange resin is used as the separation medium, and mixtures of albumin, hemoglobin and cytochrome c are used as model separation system. Equilibrium and mass-transfer parameters are developed for this system on the basis of fixed-bed chromatograph experiments. A mathematical model is then successfully used in conjunction with these parameters to simulate the performance of the CAC separations. The continuous separation performance of the annular apparatus is found to be essentially the same as the batchwise performancemore\u00a0\u00bb of an equivalent conventional chromatograph, making the unit attractive for preparative and process-scale applications where continuous throughput is desirable.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/ie00053a031\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulticomponent separations using a continuous annular chromatograph\n\nTechnical Report\nBegovich, J\n\nMulticomponent liquid chromatographic separations have been achieved by using a slowly rotating annular bed of sorbent material. By continuously introducing the feed material to be separated at a stationary point at the top of the bed and eluent everywhere else around the annulus, elution chromatography occurs. The rotation rate of the sorbent bed causes the separated components to appear as helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point; hence, the separation process is truly continuous. The continuous separation of copper, nickel, and cobalt from an ammoniacal leach liquor has been used to evaluate the behavior and capabilitiesmore\u00a0\u00bb of a variety of continuous annular chromatographs (CACs). The experimental units ranged in diameter from 89 to 445 mm and in annulus width from 6 to 51 mm. The effects of feed rate, feed concentration, rotation rate, eluent and eluent velocity, and column size were experimentally determined and modeled to show how they affect the performance of a CAC system. Use of the described models should allow confident design of new CAC units for performing continuous separations on a preparative scale. With its capability for continuously separating many components using one or a number of eluents, the CAC should make chromatography a competitive process in many industrial applications. 21 tables, 105 figures.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Similar Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Website Policies / Important Links\n Contact Us\n\nVulnerability Disclosure Program\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In his State of the Union Address (Bush 2006), President George W. Bush outlined the Advanced Energy Initiative, which seeks to reduce our national dependence on imported oil by accelerating the development of domestic, renewable alternatives to gasoline and diesel fuels. The president has set a national goal of developing cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources to substantially replace oil imports in the coming years. Fuels derived from cellulosic biomass - the fibrous, woody,more\u00a0\u00bb and generally inedible portions of plant matter - offer one such alternative to conventional energy sources that can dramatically impact national economic growth, national energy security, and environmental goals. Cellulosic biomass is an attractive energy feedstock because it is an abundant, domestic, renewable source that can be converted to liquid transportation fuels. These fuels can be used readily by current-generation vehicles and distributed through the existing transportation-fuel infrastructure. The Biomass to Biofuels Workshop, held December 7-9, 2005, was convened by the Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the Office of Science; and the Office of the Biomass Program in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The purpose was to define barriers and challenges to a rapid expansion of cellulosic-ethanol production and determine ways to speed solutions through concerted application of modern biology tools as part of a joint research agenda. Although the focus was ethanol, the science applies to additional fuels that include biodiesel and other bioproducts or coproducts having critical roles in any deployment scheme. The core barrier is cellulosic-biomass recalcitrance to processing to ethanol. Biomass is composed of nature's most ready energy source, sugars, but they are locked in a complex polymer composite exquisitely created to resist biological and chemical degradation. Key to energizing a new biofuel industry based on conversion of cellulose (and hemicelluloses) to ethanol is to understand plant cell-wall chemical and physical structures - how they are synthesized and can be deconstructed. With this knowledge, innovative energy crops - plants specifically designed for industrial processing to biofuel - can be developed concurrently with new biology-based treatment and conversion methods. Recent advances in science and technological capabilities, especially those from the nascent discipline of systems biology, promise to accelerate and enhance this development. Resulting technologies will create a fundamentally new process and biorefinery paradigm that will enable an efficient and economic industry for converting plant biomass to liquid fuels. These key barriers and suggested research strategies to address them are described in this report. As technologies mature for accomplishing this task, the technical strategy proceeds through three phases: In the research phase, within 5 years, an understanding of existing feedstocks must be gained to devise sustainable, effective, and economical methods for their harvest, deconstruction, and conversion to ethanol. Research is centered on enzymatic breakdown of cellulosic biomass to component 5- and 6-carbon sugars and lignin, using a combination of thermochemical and biological processes, followed by cofermentation of sugars to specified endproducts such as ethanol. Processes will be integrated and consolidated to reduce costs, improve efficacy, reduce generation of and sensitivity to inhibitors, and improve overall yields and viability in biorefinery environments. The technology deployment phase, within 10 years, will include creation of a new generation of energy crops with enhanced sustainability, yield, and composition, coupled with processes for simultaneous breakdown of biomass to sugars and cofermentation of sugars via new biological systems. These processes will have enhanced substrate range, temperature and inhibitor tolerance, and the capability to function in complex biorefining environments and over time scales that are economically viable. The systems-integration phase, within 15 years, will incorporate concurrently engineered energy crops and biorefineries tailored for specific agroecosystems. Employing new and improved enzymes for breaking biomass down to sugars as well as robust fermentation processes jointly consolidated into plants or microbes, these highly integrated systems will accelerate and simplify the end-to-end production of fuel ethanol. In many ways, these final-phase technologies will strive to approach theoretical conversion limits. The new generation of biotechnologies will spur engineering of flexible biorefineries operable in different agricultural regions of the country and the world.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Research Needs for Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020\n\nProgram Document\nAlivisatos, Paul; Buchanan, Michelle\n\nThis report is based on a SC/FE workshop on Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020, held March 4\u20135, 2010, to assess the basic research needed to address the current technical bottlenecks in carbon capture processes and to identify key research priority directions that will provide the foundations for future carbon capture technologies. The problem of thermodynamically efficient and scalable carbon capture stands as one of the greatest challenges for modern energy researchers. The vast majority of US and global energy use derives from fossil fuels, the combustion of which results in the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These anthropogenic emissionsmore\u00a0\u00bb are now altering the climate. Although many alternatives to combustion are being considered, the fact is that combustion will remain a principal component of the global energy system for decades to come. Today\u2019s carbon capture technologies are expensive and cumbersome and energy intensive. If scientists could develop practical and cost-effective methods to capture carbon, those methods would at once alter the future of the largest industry in the world and provide a technical solution to one of the most vexing problems facing humanity. The carbon capture problem is a true grand challenge for today\u2019s scientists. Postcombustion CO2 capture requires major new developments in disciplines spanning fundamental theoretical and experimental physical chemistry, materials design and synthesis, and chemical engineering. To start with, the CO2 molecule itself is thermodynamically stable and binding to it requires a distortion of the molecule away from its linear and symmetric arrangement. This binding of the gas molecule cannot be too strong, however; the sheer quantity of CO2 that must be captured ultimately dictates that the capture medium must be recycled over and over. Hence the CO2 once bound, must be released with relatively little energy input. Further, the CO2 must be rapidly and selectively pulled out of a mixture that contains many other gaseous components. The related processes of precombustion capture and oxycombustion pose similar challenges. It is this nexus of high-speed capture with high selectivity and minimal energy loss that makes this a true grand challenge problem, far beyond any of today\u2019s artificial molecular manipulation technologies, and one whose solution will drive the advancement of molecular science to a new level of sophistication. We have only to look to nature, where such chemical separations are performed routinely, to imagine what may be achieved. The hemoglobin molecule transports oxygen in the blood rapidly and selectively and releases it with minimal energy penalty. Despite our improved understanding of how this biological system works, we have yet to engineer a molecular capture system that uses the fundamental cooperativity process that lies at the heart of the functionality of hemoglobin. While such biological examples provide inspiration, we also note that newly developed theoretical and computational capabilities; the synthesis of new molecules, materials, and membranes; and the remarkable advances in characterization techniques enabled by the Department of Energy\u2019s measurement facilities all create a favorable environment for a major new basic research push to solve the carbon capture problem within the next decade. The Department of Energy has established a comprehensive strategy to meet the nation\u2019s needs in the carbon capture arena. This framework has been developed following a series of workshops that have engaged all the critical stakeholder communities. The strategy that has emerged is based upon a tiered approach, with Fossil Energy taking the lead in a series of applied research programs that will test and extend our current systems. ARPA-E (Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy) is supporting potential breakthroughs based upon innovative proposals to rapidly harness today\u2019s technical capabilities in ways not previously considered. These needs and plans have been well summarized in the report from a recent workshop\u2014Carbon Capture 2020, held in October 5 and 6, 2009\u2014focused on near-term strategies for carbon capture improvements (http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/ proceedings/09/CC2020/pdfs/Richards_Summary.pdf ). Yet the fact remains that when the carbon capture problem is looked at closely, we see today\u2019s technologies fall far short of making carbon capture an economically viable process. This situation reinforces the need for a parallel, intensive use-inspired basic research effort to address the problem. This was the overwhelming conclusion of a recent workshop\u2014Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020, held March 4 and 5, 2010\u2014and is the subject of the present report. To prepare for the second workshop, an in-depth assessment of current technologies for carbon capture was conducted; the result of this study was a factual document, Technology and Applied R&D Needs for Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020. This document, which was prepared by experts in current carbon capture processes, also summarized the technological gaps or bottlenecks that limit currently available carbon capture technologies. The report considered the separation processes needed for all three CO2 emission reduction strategies\u2014postcombustion, precombustion, and oxycombustion\u2014and assessed three primary separation technologies based on liquid absorption, membranes, and solid adsorption. The workshop \u201cCarbon Capture: Beyond 2020\u201d convened approximately 80 attendees from universities, national laboratories, and industry to assess the basic research needed to address the current technical bottlenecks in carbon capture processes and to identify key research priority directions that will provide the foundations for future carbon capture technologies. The workshop began with a plenary session including speakers who summarized the extent of the carbon capture challenge, the various current approaches, and the limitations of these technologies. Workshop attendees were then given the charge to identify high-priority basic research directions that could provide revolutionary new concepts to form the basis for separation technologies in 2020 and beyond. The participants were divided into three major panels corresponding to different approaches for separating gases to reduce carbon emissions\u2014liquid absorption, solid adsorption, and membrane separations. Two other panels were instructed to attend each of these three technology panels to assess crosscutting issues relevant to characterization and computation. At the end of the workshop, a final plenary session was convened to summarize the most critical research needs identified by the workshop attendees in each of the three major technical panels and from the two cross-cutting panels. The reports of the three technical panels included a set of high level Priority Research Directions meant to serve as inspiration to researchers in multiple disciplines\u2014materials science, chemistry, biology, computational science, engineering, and others\u2014to address the huge scientific challenges facing this nation and the world as we seek technologies for large-scale carbon capture beyond 2020. These Priority Research Directions were clustered around three main areas, all tightly coupled: Understand and control the dynamic atomic-level and molecular-level interactions of the targeted species with the separation media. Discover and design new materials that incorporate designed structures and functionalities tuned for optimum separation properties. Tailor capture/release processes with alternative driving forces, taking advantage of a new generation of materials. In each of the technical panels, the participants identified two major crosscutting research themes. The first was the development of new analytical tools that can characterize materials structure and molecular processes across broad spatial and temporal scales and under realistic conditions that mimic those encountered in actual separation processes. Such tools are needed to examine interfaces and thin films at the atomic and molecular levels, achieving an atomic/molecular-scale understanding of gas\u2013host structures, kinetics, and dynamics, and understanding and control of nanoscale synthesis in multiple dimensions. A second major crosscutting theme was the development of new computational tools for theory, modeling, and simulation of separation processes. Computational techniques can be used to elucidate mechanisms responsible for observed separations, predict new desired features for advanced separations materials, and guide future experiments, thus complementing synthesis and characterization efforts. These two crosscut areas underscored the fact that the challenge for future carbon capture technologies will be met only with multidisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers. In addition, it was noted that success in this fundamental research area must be closely coupled with successful applied research to ensure the continuing assessment and maturation of new technologies as they undergo scale-up and deployment. Carbon capture is a very rich scientific problem, replete with opportunity for basic researchers to advance the frontiers of science as they engage on one of the most important technical challenges of our times. This workshop report outlines an ambitious agenda for addressing the very difficult problem of carbon capture by creating foundational new basic science. This new science will in turn pave the way for many additional advances across a broad range of scientific disciplines and technology sectors.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nFull Text Available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamental bioprocessing research for coal applications\n\nTechnical Report\nKaufman, E.; Scott, T.\n\nThe purpose of this program is to gain a fundamental understanding and sound scientific and technical basis for evaluating the potential roles of innovative bioprocessing concepts for the utilization and conversion of coal. The aim is to explore the numerous ways in which advanced biological processes and techniques can open new opportunities for coal utilization or can replace more conventional techniques by using milder conditions with less energy consumption or loss. There are several roles where biotechnology is likely to be important in coal utilization and conversion. These include potential bioprocessing systems such as conversion of coal to liquids ormore\u00a0\u00bb gases; biocatalytic beneficiation of coal-derived liquids and conversion to useful chemical feedstocks; biocatalytic removal of SO{sub x} and NO{sub x} from coal combustion off-gas; environmental control technology for the removal or destruction of hazardous materials in process effluents and/or solid residues; and the removal and utilization of CO{sub 2} from combustion off-gas. Effective bioprocesses for such applications will require detailed knowledge of the biological process mechanisms and advanced bioreactor technology than can be optimized for high productivity, as well as supporting upstream and downstream processes that will allow an effective integrated bioprocess. Of particular interest is the development of predictive models that can be used for process design and scaleup. In this program, a generic approach is taken so that there will be utility over a broad range of applications. In conjunction with the generic approach, model experimental systems that address real-world problems are used to verify the results.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.2172/115411\nFull Text Available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th International Conference on the Foundations of Systems Biology in Engineering FOSBE 2018\n\nTechnical Report\nHahn, Juergen\n\nThe 7th FOSBE conference was held August 5-8 at the Hilton Chicago Oak Brook Hills Resort & Conference Center, in Chicago, Illinois. The conference was sponsored by CACHE, with technical co-sponsorship from IFAC Biosystems and Bioprocesses (TC 8.4), AIChE\u2019s Society of Biological Engineering, and IEEE\u2019s Control Systems Society. 83 participants from 11 countries met for the event; approximately 5% of participants were from industry and 43% were from countries outside the U.S. The meeting opened with a welcome reception Sunday evening, which was followed by Dr. Nathan Price, Systems Biology Institute, delivering the conference-opening lecture, \u201cMining Personal, Dense, Dynamic Datamore\u00a0\u00bb Clouds to Enhance Health and Drive Discovery\u201d. The Monday program started with the session \u201cModelling of Complex Biological Systems\u201d which included presentations from Dr. Laurence Yang (Dr. Bernhard Palsson\u2019s group, UCSD), Dr. Chris Rao (UIUC), and Dr. Alejandro Fernandez Villaverde (Dr. Julio Banga\u2019s group, IIM-CSIC, Spain). This was followed by the session \u201cIndustrial Applications of Systems and Synthetic Biology\u201d to highlight industry needs and success stories in this field. The three presenters of this session were Dr. Steve Brown (Lanzatech), Dr. Loveleena Bansal (GSK), and Dr. Will Cao (Ginkgo Bioworks). The first of two poster sessions took place over lunch (more details below). \u201cMulti-scale and Multi-omics Experimentation, Data Integration, and Modelling\u201d was the early afternoon session theme, with presentations from Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich, Switzerland), Dr. Casim Sarkar (University of Minnesota), and Dr. Jin Wang (Auburn University). The late afternoon session was entitled \u201cNetwork Inference and Modeling\u201d and included presentations by Dr. Chris Henry (Argonne), Dr. Steffen Klamt (Max Planck Institute, Magdeburg, Germany), and Mr. Joseph Muldoon (Dr. Neda Bagheri\u2019s group, Northwestern University). Conference participants were given Monday evening to enjoy the Chicago area. The Tuesday morning program kicked off with a session focusing on \u201cSynthetic Biology\u201d and speakers Dr. Huimin Zhao (UIUC), Dr. Joshua Leonhard (Northwestern University), and Dr. In Young Hwang (Dr. Matthew Chang\u2019s group, National University of Singapore). This was followed by presentations by Dr. Yann Dafour (Michigan State University), Dr. Hana El-Samad (UC San Francisco), and Mr. Yannik Schaelte (Dr. Jan Hasenauer\u2019s group, Helmholtz Zentrum-Munich, Germany) in the session \u201cNext Generation Networks and Tools\u201d. For the second time, posters were presented alongside lunch. A panel discussion on \u201cFuture Funding Directions\u201d was held on early Tuesday afternoon. The panel discussion included panelists Dr. David Babson (DoE/USDA), Dr. Haluk Resat (NIH), and Dr. Ruth Shuman (NSF). This discussion forum was followed by the late afternoon session focusing on \u201cSystems Biology of Cellular Functions\u201d. This session included presentations by Dr. Matthias Heinemann (University of Groningen, The Netherlands), Dr. Brian Ingalls (University of Waterloo, Canada), and Ms. Lindsey Brown (Harvard University), a doctoral student in Dr. Frank Doyle\u2019s group. The Systems Biology Foundation Award recognizes an individual who has made pioneering contributions to engineering approaches in systems biology. The 2018 Foundation Award was presented to Prof. Hans Westerhoff, at the Universities of Amsterdam and at the University of Manchester. His award talk was entitled, \u201cNon-Equilibrium Thermodynamics after all? Engineering Robustness through Diversity\u201d, which provided historical perspective, and glimpses of a potential future, in systems biology, while highlighting key insights derived from understanding biology across multiple scales from genes to systems. Tuesday evening ended with the conference banquet. Wednesday began with talks from Dr. Krishna Mahadevan (University of Toronto, Canada), Dr. Jennifer Reed (University of Wisconsin), and Dr. Robert Duerr (Dr. Achim Kienle\u2019s group, Max Planck Institute Magdeburg, Germany) in the area of \u201cSystems and Synthetic Biology for Biotechnology\u201d. This was followed by the last session of the conference on \u201cSystems Medicine\u201d. The presenters were Dr. Ali Cinar (IIT), Dr. Marc Birtwistle (Clemson University), and Mr. Florencio Serano Castillo (Dr. Bob Parker\u2019s group, University of Pittsburgh). This was followed by the closing remarks. 43 Contributed papers, selected from 55 submissions, were presented in two poster sessions during the meeting. The FOSBE student poster competition was coordinated by Dr. Neda Bagheri (Northwestern University), who recruited half a dozen judges to evaluate the posters for technical and presentation quality. The final selection of winners was challenging because of the overall quality of work done by the students. Poster awards were given to Ms. Nan Papili Gao from ETH Zurich and Ms. Jessica Yu from Northwestern University. The educational and training mission of the FOSBE meeting was accomplished through a half-day pre-meeting workshop for graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, junior faculty, and industry participants. Talks highlighted a variety of tools and approaches to systems biology research challenges. The workshop faculty included Drs. Joshua Leonard, Marc Birtwistle, Chris Rao, Casim Sarkar, and Jennifer Reed. The overall quality of the presentations and posters made the 2018 FOSBE meeting an unqualified technical success.

S-Sepharose, a strong-acid porous cation-exchange resin is used as the separation medium, and mixtures of albumin, hemoglobin and cytochrome c are used as model separation system. Equilibrium and mass-transfer parameters are developed for this system on the basis of fixed-bed chromatograph experiments. A mathematical model is then successfully used in conjunction with these parameters to simulate the performance of the CAC separations. The continuous separation performance of the annular apparatus is found to be essentially the same as the batchwise performancemore\u00a0\u00bb of an equivalent conventional chromatograph, making the unit attractive for preparative and process-scale applications where continuous throughput is desirable.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/ie00053a031\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSugar separations on a pilot scale by continuous annular chromatography\n\nJournal Article\nByers, C; Sisson, W; DeCarli, II, J; ... \nA pilot-scale continuous annular chromatography has been developed for scale-up and optimization studies. The chromatographic apparatus consists of a slowly rotating annular bed of sorbent material. The feed mixture which is to be separated is continuously introduced at a stationary point at the top of the bed, while eluent flows over the remainder of the annulus. The rotation of the sorbend bed coupled with the elution development induced by the downflow of eluent causes the feed components to appear as individual helical bands, each of which has a characteristic, stationary exit point. The separation of sucrose, glucose, and fructose, usingmore\u00a0\u00bb the calcium form of a cation-exchange resin, was investigated using water as the eluent. Experiments were carried out both with a synthetic mixture of the sugars as well as with an industrial feedstock. The separation was explored first in a bench-scale conventional fixed-bed column and then in the pilot-scale continuous chromatography. Factors such as column loading, feed-to-eluent ratio, and feed concentration were investigated both experimentally an theoretically. The results of bench-sale experiments were carried out in the limit of infinite dilution, almost perfectly scaled to the pilot unit when loading was low and feed mixtures were of low viscosity. Very significant deviations from ideality were, however, observed at high feed loadings, when the feed viscosity exceeded that of the eluent by more than a factor of 2.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/bp00001a003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge-scale separation of amino acids by continuous displacement chromatography\n\nTechnical Report\nDeCarli, II, J; Carta, G; Byers, C\n\nContinuous annular chromatography (CAC) is a developing technology that allows truly continuous chromatographic separations. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of this technology for the separation of various materials by isocratic elution on a bench scale. Novel applications and improved operation of the process were studied in this work, demonstrating that CAC is a versatile apparatus which is capable of separations at high throughput. Three specific separation systems were investigated. Pilot-scale separations at high loadings were performed using an industrial sugar mixture as an example of scale-up for isocratic separations. Bench-scale experiments of a low concentration metal ion mixture weremore\u00a0\u00bb performed to demonstrate stepwise elution, a chromatographic technique which decreases dilution and increases sorbent capacity. Finally, the separation of mixtures of amino acids by ion exchange was investigated to demonstrate the use of displacement development on the CAC. This technique, which perhaps has the most potential, when applied to the CAC allowed simultaneous separation and concentration of multicomponent mixtures on a continuous basis. Mathematical models were developed to describe the CAC performance and optimize the operating conditions. For all the systems investigated, the continuous separation performance of the CAC was found to be very nearly the same as the batchwise performance of conventional chromatography. The technology appears, thus, to be very promising for industrial applications.\u00ab\u00a0less\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.2172/5912255\nFull Text Available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced techniques for energy-efficient industrial-scale continuous chromatography\n\nTechnical Report\nDeCarli, II, J.; Carta, G.; Byers, C.\n\nContinuous annular chromatography (CAC) is a developing technology that allows truly continuous chromatographic separations.

Comparative studies have also been conducted using a conventional fixed-bed column packed with the same resin. Complete resolution of fructose-glucose mixtures could be obtained both in a 60-cm-long CAC and in a conventional column of the same length with a sugar feed concentration of up to 200 g/L.
