The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant
contains extensive sequence changes relative to the earlier-arising B.1, B.1.1, and DeltaSARS-CoV-2 variants that have unknown effects on viral infectivity and response toexisting vaccines. Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs), we examined muta-
tions in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron and Delta showed 4.6-fold
higher luciferase delivery overall relative to the ancestral B.1 lineage, a property con-ferred mostly by enhancements in the S and N proteins, while mutations in M and E
were mostly detrimental to assembly. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals
vaccinated with P ﬁzer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and con-
valescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower ef ﬁcacy to
prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the
ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of P ﬁzer vaccine elicited substantially higher
neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies ineight out of eight subjects compared to one out of eight preboosting. Furthermore, the
monoclonal antibody therapeutics casirivimab and imdevimab had robust neutraliza-
tion activity against B.1 and Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of OmicronVLPs, while newly authorized bebtelovimab maintained robust neutralization across
variants. Our results suggest that Omicron has similar assembly ef ﬁciency and cell entry
compared to Delta and that its rapid spread is due mostly to reduced neutralization insera from previously vaccinated subjects. In addition, most currently available monoclo-
nal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients with the excep-
tion of bebtelovimab.
Omicron jSARS-CoV-2 jvirus-like particles
Understanding the molecular determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-
navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral ﬁtness is central to effective vaccine and therapeutic
development. The emergence of viral variants including Delta and Omicron under-scores the need to assess both infectivity and antibody neutralization, but biosafety level3 handling requirements slow the pace of research on intact SARS-CoV-2. Althoughvesicular stomatitis virus and lentivirus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
protein enable evaluation of S-mediated cell binding and entry via the ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 receptors, they cannot determine effects of mutations outside the S gene(1, 2). To address these challenges, we developed SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles(SC2-VLPs) comprising the S, N, M, and E structural proteins and a packaging signal-
containing messenger RNA (mRNA) that together form RNA-loaded capsids capable
of spike-dependent cell transduction (3). This system faithfully re ﬂects the impact of
mutations in structural proteins that are observed in infections with virus isolates,enabling rapid testing of SARS-CoV-2 structural gene variants for their impact on both
infection ef ﬁciency and antibody or antiserum neutralization.
Results
Using the SC2-VLP system, we ﬁrst generated a set of plasmid constructs encoding the
S, N, M, and E structural proteins derived from the B.1, B.1.1, Delta, and OmicronSARS-CoV-2 viral variants ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ). We generated SC2-VLPs by
cotransfecting packaging cells (293T cells) with three plasmids encoding these struc-
tural proteins and a fourth plasmid encoding luciferase mRNA linked to a SARS-CoV-2
packaging signal (3). Particles secreted from these packaging cells were ﬁltered and
incubated with receiver 293T cells stably coexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1 A).
To compare the effects of the different structural gene variants on infectivity, we usedthe structural genes from SARS-CoV-2 B.1 as the point of reference from which toSigniﬁcance

vary each structural gene individually since it is ancestral to all
currently circulating variants. For each combination of struc-
tural proteins, we evaluated the luciferase expression in receiver
cells, the expression level of the S and N proteins in packagingcells, and abundance of the S and N proteins and luciferaseRNA in the supernatant (Fig. 1 B–G).
Weﬁrst examined the S genes of B.1, Delta, and Omicron
variants using VLPs that otherwise contained B.1 gene versions.We found that relative to S-B.1 (identical to S-B.1.1) the Delta
S-variant produced VLPs that were only 40% as infectious
(Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the Omicron S gene in the context ofthe B.1 background generated higher VLP infectivity compared
to ancestral S-B.1 (Fig. 1 B). Expression of S in packaging cells
and supernatant (Fig. 1 FandGandSI Appendix , Fig. S1 ) was
similar between these variants, suggesting that this discrepancyis due to intrinsic ef ﬁciency of the Omicron S protein when
incorporated into VLPs. Interestingly, pseudotyped lentiviral
particles show the opposite pattern of increased entry for
S-Delta and reduced entry for S-Omicron ( SI Appendix , Fig.
S2). In addition, the cleavage and processing of S also varied
not only between different S-variants but also when coexpressed
with different M and N variants (Fig. 1 FandG). These resultsM

suggest that viral genetic context including proteolytic process-
ing and secretion pathway in ﬂuences S gene effects on the abil-
ity of viral particles to transduce cells, and also that some S
gene mutations such as those in Omicron may dominate cellinfectivity outcomes.
We next compared the effects of N variants on infectivity of
VLPs generated using B.1 genes. The N gene was found previ-ously to have a pronounced in ﬂuence on infectivity and RNA
packaging ef ﬁciency (3). Required for replication, RNA binding,
packaging, stabilization, and release, the N protein includes a
seven-amino-acid mutational hotspot (N:199 to 205) in a regionlinking the N- and C-terminal domains. Notably, B.1.1, Delta,and Omicron, but not B.1, include mutations at R203 that were
found previously to enhance VLP infectivity and RNA packaging
(SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 2 ) (3). The N-Delta and N-Omicron var-
iants generated signi ﬁcantly higher N expression in the superna-
tant with higher RNA packaging (Fig. 1 GandSI Appendix ,F i g .
S1) and infectivity that was enhanced relative to both B.1 and
B.1.1 variants, consistent with the N protein ’sp l a y i n gac e n t r a l
role in viral packaging and cell transduction ef ﬁciency (Fig. 1 C).

mutation in the E protein relative to B.1/Delta. VLPs generatedusing either M or E protein from Omicron, but with B.1 versionsof the other structural components, showed levels of infectivity that

that some Omicron mutations reduce particle assembly and may
reduce viral ﬁtness. To test if these effects are mitigated by muta-
tions in other structural proteins, we also tested VLPs generatedusing the combined structural protein mutations for each variant.We found that Omicron VLPs were overall 4.6 times as infectious
as VLPs generated using B.1 structural proteins but similar in infec-
tivity to VLPs generated using Delta or B.1.1 structural proteins,consistent with observed enhancements (S and N) and de ﬁcits (M
and E) seen in the individual proteins (Fig. 1 E).
We next tested the VLP neutralization capability of antisera
collected from 38 individuals 4 to 6 wk postvaccination with
Pﬁzer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines,
or convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors.The antisera were collected from participants aged 18 to 50 yenrolled in a clinical trial led by Curative, and SARS-CoV-2immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were quanti ﬁed with an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ( SI Appendix ,
Table S5 ). The serum was heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min
and then incubated with VLPs at dilutions 1/20, 1/80, 1/320,1/1280, 1/5120, and 1/20,480 for a total of six dilutions. VLPs
were generated with B.1 structural genes except for N-R203M,
which we previously found to enhance assembly and increasethe dynamic range of our neutralization assay. In initial experi-ments using B.1 spike we found that sera from both P ﬁzer/
BioNTech- and Moderna-vaccinated individuals yielded high
neutralization titers with medians of 549 and 490, respectively(Table 1). Sera from Johnson & Johnson –vaccinated and con-
valescent patients had lower titers with median of 25 and 35,respectively (Table 1), matching the low levels of SARS-CoV-2
IgG antibodies detected in this cohort ( SI Appendix , Table S5 ).
We also checked whether neutralizing titers as measured byVLPs correlated with titers measured using virus isolates orS-protein IgG measured by ELISA. We found that titers mea-
sured using VLPs correlated well with neutralization of virus
isolates with r
2=0.98 but did not correlate with anti-S IgG,
suggesting that some subjects may generate antibodies thatbind but do not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ( SI Appendix , Figs. S3
and S4 ).
We then substituted the S-gene with S-variants previously
tested, as they have varying mutations in the receptor bindingdomain (RBD) known to affect neutralization. We tested the
neutralization capacity of each patient ’s serum against VLPs
representing S from B.1, Delta, or Omicron viral variants (Fig.
2A–D). There was a pronounced decrease of 15- to 18-fold in
potency against Omicron, with intermediate effects on Delta,for the antisera from mRNA vaccine recipients (Fig. 2 A–D
and Table 1). Limited ef ﬁcacy was detected for any of the sera
from those vaccinated with the adenovirus-based Johnson &
Johnson vaccine and variable neutralization was observed for
COVID-19 survivors (Table 1). We next examined whetherClass 1 or Class 3 mutations were responsible for reduced neu-
tralization in patient anti sera. For both S-OmC1 and OmC3
cases we found intermediate neutralization, suggesting that neu-
tralization escape from patient sera is a function of several
mutations acting in concert ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 A–D). Third-
dose vaccination with the P ﬁzer vaccine increased titers against
all variants including Omicron (Fig. 2 E–H,SI Appendix , Fig.
S5E–G, and Table 2) as measured at 16 and 21 d after the
third dose. All eight sera from this cohort had low (median 64)
neutralization titers against Omicron 21 d after their thirddose, while only one out of eight had detectable neutralization
prior to boosting (Fig. 2 G). However, even after boosting we
observed eightfold reduced neutralizing titers against Omicron
compared to B.1, suggesting that Omicron is still able to par-
tially escape neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccinationwith the ancestral S-B.1 (Fig. 2 Hand Table 2).
We next tested whether therapeutic and commercially avail-
able monoclonal antibodies could neutralize VLP entry medi-
ated by the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 S protein or the S protein
from Omicron. Therapeutic antibodies casirivimab (Regeneron),Table 1. Neutralization titers of vaccinated or convalescent

imdevimab (Regeneron), sotrovimab (Vir/GSK), and bebtelovi-
mab (AbCellera/Eli Lilly) all demonstrated excellent neutralizingIC
50s (concentrations that inhibit response by 50%) against B.1 S
protein, but only sotrovimab and bebtelovimab neutralized Omi-
cron S protein (Fig. 3). Interestingly, sotrovimab was less effectiveagainst Delta and Omicron compared to B.1, while the recentlyauthorized bebtelovimab had potent neutralization against all var-iants with an IC
50of less than 10 ng/mL.
We also generated S-variants containing Omicron mutations
outside the RBD but containing only mutations within the
RBD previously shown to inhibit binding by Class 1 (417N,
496S, 498R, 501Y) or Class 3 (440K, 446S, 496S, 498R) anti-bodies ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ) (4). Previous studies have
shown that the binding of casirivimab and imdevimab and
other Class 1 and Class 3 antibodies is particularly sensitive to
mutations at these residues. We generated VLPs using OmC1or OmC3 S genes and evaluated the neutralization of casirivi-mab and imdevimab monoclonal antibodies (Table 3). Strik-ingly, although both antibodies had robust neutralization
activity against B.1.1 or Delta VLPs, no activity was detected
for either one against Omicron VLPs. We found that casirivi-mab was able to neutralize OmC3 but not OmC1, andimdevimab was able to neutralize OmC1 but not OmC3. This
suggests that the six mutations within the Omicron RBD
(K417N, N440K, G446S, G496S, Q498R, N501Y) are largely
responsible for the failure of these monoclonal antibodies toneutralize Omicron S.Pre

Discussion
In summary, SARS-CoV-2 VLPs that transduce reporter mRNA
into ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells enabled a rapid and
comprehensive comparison of structural protein (S, E, M, N) vari-
ant effects on both particle infectivity and antibody neutralization.Using this system, we found that the Omicron versions of both Sand N enhance VLP infectivity relative to ancestral viral variants
including Delta. Omicron maintains mutations in the N muta-
tional hotspot that were shown previously to confer markedlyenhanced VLP infectivity (3). Surprisingly, Omicron M and E
gene variants appear to compromise infectivity, at least in the con-
text of ancestral versions of the other structural genes, implyingthat genes including S and N override less- ﬁtv e r s i o n so fM ,E ,
and perhaps other genes in the intact virus. Monitoring S and N
gene evolution and determining why the N gene has such a pro-nounced effect on viral particle infectivity may enable develop-
ment of better diagnostics, more broadly neutralizing vaccine
development, and potentially new therapeutics.
Notably, all antisera from vaccinated individuals or convales-
cent sera from COVID-19 survivors showed reduced neutraliza-
tion of Omicron VLPs relative to ancestral variants including
Delta, with mRNA vaccines far surpassing a viral vector vaccineor natural infection in initial potency. These data do not account
for T cell-based immunity induced by vaccination or prior infec-
tion. We also found that Omicron S mutations interfere withClass 1 and Class 3 monoclonal antibody binding, renderingsome commercially available therapeutic antibodies completely
ineffective. These results suggest that prior to vaccine boosting,antibodies produced by mRNA vaccines have 15- to 18-fold
reduced ef ﬁcacy against Omicron, and that the Johnson & John-
son vaccine produces limited neutralizing antibodies against any
SARS-CoV-2 variant. Booster shots increase neutralization titers
against Omicron but the titers remain much lower than for previ-ous variants. Consistent with data from recent pseudovirus neu-
tralization studies (5, 6), these ﬁndings support the use of mRNA
vaccine boosters to enhance antibody-based protection againstOmicron infection, in lieu of vaccines tailored to Omicron itself.
Our approach for analyzing the impact of mutations in structural
proteins has a few limitations. We assume that mutations in the
structural proteins act independently of each other and of the othernonstructural genes of the virus. Our results are consistent with
a d d i t i v ee f f e c t so fN ,M ,E ,a n dSm u t a t i o n s ,b u tt h i sm a yn o tb e
the case when combined with other viral proteins. It would beinteresting to see if similar results would be obtained in infectious
clones incorporating the entire genome and testing these mutations
combinatorially, but this is infeasible due to the large number of
mutations. In addition, we cannot separate infectious VLPs from
defective particles and exosomes, which may affect the interpreta-tions of our conclusions regarding the compositions of VLPs.

1μgo fD N Aw e r ed i l u t e di n5 0 μL Opti-MEM. Three micrograms of PEI (polyethyle-
neimine) was diluted in 50 μL Opti-MEM and added to plasmid dilution quickly to
complex the DNA. Transfection mixture was incubated for 20 min at room tempera-
ture and then added dropwise to 293T cells in 0.5 mL of Dulbecco ’sm o d i ﬁed Eagle ’s
medium (DMEM) containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin.
Media was changed after 24 h of transfection, and at 48 h posttransfection VLP-
containing supernatant was collected and ﬁltered using a 0.45- μms y r i n g e ﬁlter. For
other culture sizes, the mass of DNA used was 1 μg for 24-well, 4 μg for 6-well, 20
μg for 10-cm plate, and 40 μg for 15-cm plate. Opti-MEM volumes were 100 μL,
400μL, 1 mL, and 3 mL, respectively, and PEI was always used at 3:1 mass ratio.
Western Blot. For Western blots of lysates, media was removed and cells were
rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then lysed for 20 min in
N-PER lysis buffer containing Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture.
For Western blots of ultracentrifuge-concentrated VLPs, 10 mL of VLP supernatant
from a 10-cm plate was pelleted (28,000 rpm, 2 h, SW41 Ti, 1 mL 20% sucrose
cushion), the supernatant was discarded, and VLPs were resuspended in 50 μL
of PBS. Fifteen microliters of concentrated VLPs were used to Western blot.
Laemmli loading buffer (1 ×ﬁnal) and dithiothreitol (DTT, 40 mM ﬁnal) were
added to lysates or VLP solution and heated at 95 °C for 5 min to lyse VLPs and
denature proteins. Samples were loaded on to 4 to 20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad)
and transferred to a poly(vinylidene di ﬂuoride) membrane (Bio-Rad). Membrane
was blocked in 3% BSA (N-staining) or 10% NFDM (all others) and stained with
primary antibody: anti-N (Abcam ab273434, 1:500 dilution), anti-S (Abcam
ab272504, 1:1,000), anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz sc-365062, 1:1,000), or anti-p24
(Sigma, 1:2,000) for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were rinsed with TBS-T three
times for 10 min each and stained with secondary antibody (Abcam ab205719,mouse, 1:5,000), and imaged using a Pierce chemiluminescence kit.
Northern Blot. VLPs collected from a 10-cm plate were concentrated by ultracentri-
fugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (28,000 rpm, 2 h, SW41 Ti). The superna-
tant was discarded and VLPs were resuspended in 50 μL of PBS. Twenty microliters
of concentrated VLPs were used for Northern blotting. VLPs were lysed by adding
500μL of TRIzol (Sigma) and RNA was extracted by phase separation, precipitated
with isopropanol with GlycoBlue, and washed with 75% ethanol. RNA was resus-
pended in 30 μL of water, added to 30 μL2×RNA Loading Dye (NEB) and dena-
tured at 65 °C for 15 min then loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 1 ×MOPS
and 4% formaldehyde. Samples were run at room temperature for 12 h at 20 V and
transferred by capillary action to nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized
with a32P-labeled luciferase DNA probe (Prime-a-Gene Labeling System; Promega)
and visualized using a phosphoscreen on a Typhoon imager (GE).
Quantification of Western and Northern Blots. Images were analyzed
using Fiji. First, the background was subtracted using a 50-pixel-radius rolling
ball and then total intensities were measured for each band. In the case of S pro-
tein, intensity of the bands corresponding to complete S and S2 were added
together. Intensities of each band were ﬁrst normalized based on the brightness
of each blot and then normalized to the “All B.1 ”condition. Data were analyzed
in GraphPad Prism using one-way ANOVA with repeated measures comparing
each condition to the “All B.1 ”condition and using Dunnett ’s correction.
Luciferase Readout. In each well of a clear 96-well plate 50 μLo fS C 2 -
VLP –containing supernatant was added to 50 μL of cell suspension containing
50,000 receiver cells (293T ACE2/TMPRSS2). Cells were allowed to attach and
take up VLPs overnight. The next day, supernatant was removed and cells were
lysed in 20 μL passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature
with gentle rocking. Lysates were transferred to an opaque white 96-well plate
and 30 μL of reconstituted luciferase assay buffer was added and mixed with
each lysate. Luminescence was measured immediately after mixing using a Tecan
plate reader with no attenuation and a luminescence integration time of 1 s.
Cell Lines. Cells were maintained in a humidi ﬁed incubator at 37 °Ci n5 %C O 2
in the indicated media and passaged every 3 to 4 d. The 293T cells were obtained
from ATCC and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomy-
cin. The 293T cells stably coexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were generated
through sequential transduction of 293T cells with TMPRSS2-encoding (generated
using Addgene plasmid no. 170390, a gift from Nir Hacohen, Broad Institute,
Cambridge, MA, USA) and ACE2-encoding (generated using Addgene plasmid
no. 154981, a gift from Sonja Best, Rocky Mountain Labs, Hamilton, MT, USA)lentiviruses and selection with hygromycin (250 μg/mL) and blasticidin
(10μg/mL) for 10 d, respectively. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was veri ﬁed by

from A. Creanga and B. Graham, NIH, Bethesda, MD) were maintained at 37 °C
and 5% CO 2in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 ug/
mL penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco), and 10 μg/mL of puromycin (Gibco).
VLP Neutralization Assay. Each heat-inactivated serum sample was serially
diluted from 1:20 to 1:20,480 dilution in complete DMEM media prior to incu-
bation (1 h at 37 °C) with 40 μL VLP with total volume of 50 μL, then plated
onto receiver cells (50,000 293T ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells). Twenty-four hours later
luciferase readout was taken. Neutralization (NT50) was estimated by interpolat-
ing the dilution of serum at which 50% infectivity was reduced.
Serum Samples. Serum samples from individuals not exposed to SARS-CoV-2
(pre-COVID, control), exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (post-COVID), and those vaccinated
with either two doses of elasomeran (Moderna), two doses of tozinameran (P ﬁzer/
BioNTech) vaccine, or one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine were collected
through a clinical trial led by Curative ( SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 5 ). Post-COVID samples
reﬂect nonvaccinated participant samples that were collected within 4 to 6 wk of
the original positive test and were negative by PCR at the time of serum collection.
Serum from vaccinated participants was collected 4 to 6 wk postvaccination follow-
ingﬁnal dose. The clinical trial protocol was approved by Advarra under
Pro00054108 for a study designed to investigate immune escape by SARS-CoV-2
variants. The trial has been submitted to the clinicaltrials.gov registry
(NCT05171803, Unique Protocol ID: PTL-2021-0007). Sample specimens were col-
lected from adult individuals aged 18 to 50 y who either had been vaccinated for
COVID-19 and/or had a history of COVID-19. Vulnerable populations were excluded
from enrollment. Patients signed consent forms held by Curative. Participants were
enrolled from individuals that tested with Curative in Los Angeles County and were
sent an institutional review board –approved email enrollment script. Those who
were interested were contacted by the Curative Clinical Trials research team (CITI
trained) and those who consented to the study were scheduled for sample collec-
tion by a clinician who went to their residence. Participants underwent a standard
venipuncture procedure. Brie ﬂy, licensed phlebotomists collected a maximum of
15 mL whole blood. Once collected, the sample was left at ambient temperature
for 30 to 60 min to coagulate then was centrifuged at 2,200 to 2,500 rpm for 15
min at room temperature. Samples were then placed on ice until delivered to the
laboratory site where the serum was aliquoted to appropriate volumes for storage
at/C080°C until use. A quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA was performed on serum
specimens (EuroImmun, Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA [IgG], 2606-9621G, NJ). To quantify
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, an S1-speci ﬁc monoclonal IgG antibody with no known
cross-reactivity to the S2 domain of the spike protein was used as a reference anti-
body. A standard curve was developed using a monoclonal IgG antibody targeting
the S1 antigen of SARS-CoV-2 at different concentrations with a polynomial regres-
sion curve- ﬁtting model. The standard curve was used to calculate the sample IgG
antibody concentration. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56 °Cf o r3 0m i n
prior to use in VLP assays. Pre-COVID sera was pooled into one sample.
SARS-CoV-2 Culture. SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/USA-WA1/2020 (WA1) (BEI NR-
52281), B.1.617.2 (BEI NR-55611), and B.1.1.529 (California Department of
Health) were used for serum virus neutralization. The virus infection experiments
were performed in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Working stocks of SARS-CoV-2
were made in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and were stored at /C080°C until used.
Virus Neutralization Assay. Serum dilutions (50 μL) of 1:5, 1:15, 1:45,
1:135, 1:405, and 1:1,215 were prepared in serum-free DMEM. The dilutions
were separately added with 50 plaque-forming units (50 μL) of SARS-CoV-2
WA1, B.1.617.2, or B.1.1.529. The mixture was mixed gently and incubated at
37°C for 30 min, followed by a plaque assay.
Plaque Assays. Vero-TMPRSS2 were seeded and incubated overnight. The cells
were inoculated with the neutralized inoculum in serum-free DMEM. After the 1-h
absorption period, the media in the wells was overlaid with 2.5% Avicel (Dupont,
RC-591). After 72 h, the overlay was removed, the cells were ﬁxed in 10% formalin
for 1 h and stained with crystal violet for visualization of plaque-forming units.
